            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three eſpecial Requirables in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of War by Land: <hi>Munitions, Men, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi>

            <p>Under <hi>Munitions</hi> are comprehended all ſuch materials, or things in general, as a War cannot be without: And theſe, <hi>via apparanda ſunt, ut vincas celerius.</hi> And the principal of theſe are,

            <p>The ſecond Requirable being <hi>Men</hi> or Bodies, are diſtinguiſhed into Common-Souldiers, and Officers or Commanders: Of Common-Souldiers, there are Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Horſe-men, or the Infantry and Cavalry: Of Commanders; the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſſimo (who is to be onely One, under the penalty of loſing All) and his Sub-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, as the Lieutenant-General, the Lord Marſhal, the Serjeant-Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Colonel-General, with the reſt of the Officers of the Field, hereafter to be particularized.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The neceſſity of Treaſures. How they are attained by ſeveral Princes: and how they may be best preſerved.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AND firſt of the firſt principal, (Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Treaſure) included under the firſt Requiſite, which is <hi>Munition.</hi> Now Treaſure or Monies are juſtly termed the ſinews of a War, as without which no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly War can march or be managed: and therefore not to be undertaken (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially offenſively) without a ſufficiencie of this kind, timely and beforehand laid up. The wiſe VVarriour, as well as the wiſe Builder, being in the firſt place to fore-caſt his accounts and future expences, before he enter upon any Action of this Nature. And herein the main difficulties are how to attain them, and how to preſerve them.</p>
               <p>The Tyrants of the Eaſt, as the great <hi>Sultan,</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Mogol,</hi> and the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> furniſh their vaſt expences of this kind, by being abſolute Lords of all their peoples Eſtates, who are all their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:191816:7"/>ſlaves. The Chriſtian Princes, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not ſo far this way, but govern more moderately, do this much after one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, allowing onely ſome petty varieties; as the Monarchs of <hi>Spain,</hi> by their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms upon imported and exported Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, but in particular and chiefly by their rich and unexhauſted Mines in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Kings by Cuſtoms like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and Impoſts, and eſpecially Impoſts upon Salt. The Monarchs of <hi>Great Britain</hi> by Cuſtoms alſo, but moſt ſubſtantially and thoroughly by Subſidies and Fifteens granted in Parliament. As for the reſt of the mixed Monarchs, as thoſe of <hi>Poland, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Swedeland,</hi> they do the ſame, by the ſame ways, with little or no difference; onely the great Duke or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> as he is the neareſt neighbour to the Eaſtern Tyrants fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, ſo he cometh neareſt unto them in this kind of Tyrannie eſpecially. As touching the Common-wealths of Chriſtendom, governed in a kind of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical way, as thoſe of <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,</hi> and <hi>Switzers,</hi> and ſome others, more pettie, as that of <hi>Lucca, Genoa,</hi> and ſome of the free Towns in <hi>Germany;</hi> though in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:191816:7"/>the means of their raiſing their Treaſures they differ not much from the abſolute Princes forementioned, yet can they bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enlarge themſelves according to their occaſions, as being done by a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and not at the will or pleaſure of any One in particular. Hence is it that the United States in the Low-Countries, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been forced by their exigents to nurſe themſelves up by a War, adventured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Addition to all the former Chriſtian courſes, by their Taxes upon all ſorts of Victuals, called Exciſes; and hereby fill their Exchequers, and to admiration have maintained a long VVar againſt a Potent Enemie.</p>
               <p>I intend not to enlarge my ſelf farther in this particular of procuring Treaſure, as being a work rather appropriated to the States-man then Souldier: onely I ſhall take liberty to paſs a Souldier-like Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon them in brief; as, That that of the Tyrants is ſo inſupportable, as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected to attend any other opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, then to clear it ſelf by a general Revolt; and therefore muſt be made good by as general a ſtrength, which muſt needs exhauſt any Treaſure, be it never ſo great,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:191816:8"/>and make the Poſſeſſors poor, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo rich: That that of the Chriſtian Princes muſt needs be ſubjected to many caſualties; as, to a decreaſe in Cuſtoms by the point of Trading, to the hazards of loſs when imported from the Mines in Foreign Parts, to the diſcontenting of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject when upon occaſion they ſhall be never ſo little increaſed and innovated, and to over-tedious and dangerous delays (not to ſpeak farther) when they are to be had by conſent of Parliaments: ſo that the Low-Country way, when (as now with them) it hath gotten a Preſcription by Time, and a Toleration by Cuſtom, ſeemeth preferrable to them all, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in regard of the certainty of having them.</p>
               <p>As for the preſerving of them when they are gotten, I ſhall onely ſay, that it may be ſureſt done, either by melting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bullion or VVedges, and ſo to coin them upon occaſion (as was the practice of the Ancients) or to lend them out for ſome ſmall profit to particular perſons, upon good caution: an eſpecial care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had withal, that the Officers of the Exchequers be men of integritie, choſen
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:191816:8"/>rather out of perſons of honourable birth and breeding, then of Mechanicks, and men of baſe condition and qualitie. And thus we have done all we mean to do about the firſt principal, included under the firſt Requirable, which is <hi>Munition.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Armours of proof. Of Buff-Coats, and quilted Jacks. The length of the Pike. Pikes not to be over-long.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE ſhall ſpeak in the next place, and in this ſecond Chapter, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principal contained under the firſt Requirable, that is, of <hi>Arms;</hi> and firſt, of Defenſive, and thoſe fitted for the bodies of men: touching which, I ſhall not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize in the pieces and names, well enough known to every Train-band-man; but only enquire into the uſe, and when they ſeem beſt fitted for ſervice, and for the turn they are provided.</p>
               <p>And firſt of thoſe called Arms of proof. A proof indeed of the degeneration of mens ſpirits and courage, and wherewith
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:191816:9"/>the wearers become ſo over-charged, and ſhackled, that they ſeem chiefly prepared to fight againſt the ſhock and brunt of their own coats of Steel; and as if bound rather to defend their Arms, then their Arms them.</p>
               <p>In which regard (for mine own part) I find no reaſon why they ſhould be in any great requeſt. For ſhould there be found one man of a thouſand ſo well underlaid as to march or ſtand under one of them, yet ſhall he not be able to fight, no not to keep his legs againſt the force of a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-ſhot within point-blank, or a level Range: for though perhaps it pierce not his thick armour, yet ſhall it ſure enough lay the bearer on his back, there to lie until he find a Comrade or two to ſet him on his feet, or be troden to death with the preaſe of his own ſide. And truly there is but little difference, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of aſſiſtance to his Partie, or ſafetie to himſelf, between a mans being killed by a Muſquet-ſhot by the want of his boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Arms, and his being overthrown and tortured to death by having them upon him.</p>
               <p>I deny not, but ſuch kind of Arms as are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:191816:9"/>defenſible againſt the Sword, the puſh of the Pike, and the force of a Piſtol-ſhot, may be uſefully born: and I make it a Quere whether this may not be done as well by a good Buff-coat, or at the leaſt, by thoſe quilted Jacks (in my opinion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providently left off of late) uſed by our old brave Engliſh Archers, as by any iron Armour whatſoever: for theſe, when they are not pierceable, are not wearable; and when pierceable, make the wound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable for the moſt part, by having a piece of the iron of the Armour carried into the body before the bullet. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, (unleſs we will fall out with moſt of the Ancients in point of credit) it muſt be granted, that they had the uſe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain linen Arms of excellent proof and uſe. And <hi>Justus Lipſius (lib.</hi> 8. <hi>dial.</hi> 6.) out of <hi>Nicetus</hi> his Chronicle, thus deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth one of them: <hi>Conradus</hi> (ſaith he) fought without a Target, and in lieu of a Curace, he had a woven weed made of Flax, ſoaked in ſowre Wine, well ſalted withal, and often folded. It was ſo ſure againſt outward force, being thus fulled, ſalted, and folded, that it could not be pierced with Iron or Steel. <hi>Plinie (Hiſt.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:191816:10"/>Nat. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 48.) alſo maketh mention of the like. And <hi>Caeſar (De Bel. Civ. l.</hi> 3.) hath ſomewhat to this purpoſe. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is much to be pitied, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention hath been loſt to our age.</p>
               <p>The next Weapon Defenſive (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Horſe) is that of the Pike, of which the moſt conſiderable is the length. Touching which, it is generally held, that it ought not to be ſhorter then eight Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, which make twelve foot. Some Pikes (among the Ancients) have been found ſixteen foot in length: witneſs <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyenus (lib.</hi> 2. <hi>in Cleon. Sect.</hi> 2.) where he ſaith, that <hi>Cleonymus</hi> beſieging <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> and having overthrown the VVall of the City, the Pikemen (ſaith he) ſallied out, whoſe Pikes were ſixteen cubits in length. And it is not to be denied, but that ſhort Pikes are greatly diſadvantaged, having to do with ſuch as over-lengthen them: for with a long Pike, a man is able to ſtrike and kill his enemie, and himſelf not be touched. And hereof <hi>Patricius (Parel. part.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8.) gives us an example at the battel of <hi>Sorano,</hi> where <hi>Vitellozze Vitelli</hi> diſcomfited the <hi>Almanes</hi> only with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Pikes; his (ſaith the Story) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:191816:10"/>an arms length longer then thoſe of the Enemies. And at our being at the Iſland of <hi>Rey,</hi> after the Enemies horſe (at our firſt landing) charging furiouſly French-like, were moſt of them ſlain in the place by our foot, and their Bodies of Pikes came up to the puſh of ours; It was obſerved, that our Pikes were longer then theirs, and this was thought to be one main cauſe of our ſo ſuddain and thorow routing of them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs (in my opinion) a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is to be had, that no Pikes be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be over-long, leſt they both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the meaſure of his ſtrength and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement that is to uſe them, and by their over-length do over-ſway them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſo by hanging crooked when they are to be charged, do hinder both the force and certaintie of their ſtroke. I hold therefore, that the proportionable and due length of a Pike may be, when the head of the Pike of the fourth man in the depth of the File, being charged, ſhall ſomewhat advance beyond the face and ſhoulder of the File-leader. And the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary length now required in Pikes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fifteen foot, is well-near anſwerable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:191816:11"/>hereunto. As for the Three-quarter-Pikes and Half-Pikes, they are ſerviceable and proper to be uſed upon the walls of Towns, and behind Ramparts, Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and in Trenches; but not ſo for ſervices againſt Horſe, and in <hi>Campagnia.</hi> And thus far concerning the Weapons of Defence, proper for the bodies of Men.</p>

               <p>Now theſe are to be ſuch by Nature, as may be made inexpugnable by Art, or at the leaſt brought to the neareſt terms of being ſo. Of which kindes are Rocks, Iſlands, Hills, and Necks of Land. But herein it is carefully to be obſerved, that none of theſe places be commanded by an external height; or if they be, that that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:191816:11"/>part be fortified alſo. Obſervation is alſo to be made, that the ſoil of the part be not Sandie; for then there can be no repairs either againſt Battery or Sap. Reſpect is likewiſe to be had to the air, that it be wholſom, and eſpecially that the place be well provided with water; and ſo, that it cannot be cut off by the Enemie: That it be in a Country well furniſhed with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual of all kindes; and withal ſo ſited, that it may ſerve as a Bull-work unto that Country, either by a Guard of a Port, or the Defence of a Paſſage: That it be apt to offend an Enemy on all ſides by Sallies; for ſo it ſhall be apt alſo to be relieved, and cannot be blockt up with any one Fort alone: That it be not ſo great as to require over-many men to Man and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it; nor ſo little as not of capacity to receive a ſufficiencie of hands to give an impediment to an Enemie in his paſſage: the mean betwixt theſe two, being, when in the Diameter it conſiſteth of three or four hundred paces: and laſtly, That it be in ſuch a part, as that no Siege can be brought before it, but by an Army divided. To which end, the ſituation upon Rivers, and Tongues of Land lying betwixt two
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:191816:12"/>Rivers, are moſt proper and convenient. And theſe are the uſual Advertiſements and Obſervations to be made and received in the point of choice of the Place and Part that is fit for Fortification.

               <p>THe part proper for Fortification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus found, ſome Caveats are to be received touching the perfecting of the works. And theſe are, that an eſpecial care be taken, that the Bull-works be not hollow, and that the <hi>Piazza</hi> or Plain thereof be raiſed equal with the Rampart to the foot of the Parapet: And that there be no Vault nor Caſemate that may give Impediment to the play of the great Guns, either by blindings with ſmoak, or any other way: That no Angle of a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work be over-ſmall, leſt it prove eaſie to be battered; nor over-large, leſt the point with a ſmall battery be hidden from the flank: That every Bull-work have his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:191816:13"/>Counter-mine; the which, though ſome think (by way of ſaving of charge) may be timely enough done when an Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to make his Approaches, yet for my part I cannot approve of ſo thrifty a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: That every Bull-work have two Sally-Ports as ſecretly contrived as may be; to which end, the Angle of the ears of the Bull-work is the moſt proper part: That every Flank regard the face of the oppoſite Bull-work, that ſo the Enemy may be diſlodged from Mining the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: That the Angle of the Flank be a right Angle; becauſe an obtuſe Angle layeth the Cannoniers or Port-holes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>open, and a ſharp Angle diſordereth the Face of the <hi>Piazza</hi> of the Bull-work, and of the ears thereof: That there be in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Flank, one piece of Ordnance at the leaſt, ſo ſecured, as that it may ſerve for a conſtant defence for the oppoſite Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work: That the Port-holes next to the Angles of the Curtain, lie as little diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd as poſſibly may be; provided never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, that they regard and ſcour the ditch and the covered way, or falſe Bray, with ſome part of the circumjacent <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnia;</hi> That the defence of the Face of

               </head>
               <p>WE are in the next place to make ſome advertiſements touching ſuch pieces of Fortification as are defective, either in reſpect of Form, or otherwiſe: and all ſuch are ſo to be held, which participate not of the correſpondence and defence which they ſhould borrow one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Now this mal-correſpondence may be reformed, by giving to the parts of the ſame denomination, equal proportion in heighth, breadth, length and declination, if the ſituation will poſſibly permit. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:191816:14"/>the defences are ſecured and amended by increaſing of the points of the Bulworks to ſuch a moderation, as that they be not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the prohibited terms of ſharpneſs; the which for all that, ſerves not for the reformation of all old Works, but onely for ſuch as are regular.</p>
               <p>As for the irregular (beſides the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of particular members) it will be needful to build ſome new and entire bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Fortification. The truth is, that in the reforming of the ſubſtance and main of old Works, more labour is to be uſed then skill; for herein it is onely neceſſary to fill the Bulwork, if it be hollow; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the thickneſs of the Curtains and Parapets, if they be not ſufficient to reſiſt a Batterie; to make the ditches deeper, broader or narrower, as cauſe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; to cut a Counter-ſcarp with his Ravelins and Flankers round about; to advance the <hi>Spalto,</hi> or ſhoulder, if it be over-low, to the heigh of the <hi>Cordone;</hi> to increaſe or diminiſh the ſcarp, as need ſhall require: and laſtly, to repair the <hi>Camiſcia</hi> if it be ruinous.</p>
               <p>As for ſuch Fortreſſes as are ſited on Sandie Grounds, being in themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:191816:15"/>without remedy againſt battery or ſap, the natural defect is to be ſupplied by an Artificial <hi>Camiſcia</hi> of wood, made with ſuch proportion of Scarp and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as that it cannot be ruined but by much time and great labour. And when the Curtains are exceſſively long, and thereby defective, the Redreſs may be either by a Cavalier or a Platform, or by ſetting the Flanks the nearer one unto another. But the beſt way is to make two Curtains of one, and to raiſe a new Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work in the midſt between them. And the <hi>Spalla</hi> may be perfected by either the ſame, with a new <hi>Camiſcia,</hi> or by retiring the Curtain farther into the Fortreſs. As for the defects of the <hi>Gola</hi> of a Bulwork, they are not to be reformed and made wider, but by removing of the Spallaes ſo much as is needful, towards them of the oppoſite Bulwork.</p>
               <p>As for the Forms of Works of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Triangular and Square ones are juſtly the moſt imperfect of all others, by reaſon that the Bulworks muſt of force become over-ſharp in the points (and eſpecially in the Triangular Form) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are eaſily battered in that part,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:191816:15"/>to the extream danger of the whole Piece; by reaſon that the Enemie cannot be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from thoſe parts, but may ſafely come to the aſſault, without being endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in Flank: and beſides, if the Parapet chance to be beaten down by the ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſite cauſed by an acute Angle, all place is abſolutely taken away for a retreat, and no room left to erect another in its ſtead, either with Gabions or Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In theſe reſpects it may therefore be concluded, that the beſt Forms of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Towns, are thoſe which conſiſt of moſt ſides, as neareſt approaching to the circular Form, which is the moſt capable of all others, and by conſequent can afford the more commodities for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of ſtrong and ample Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and have the Angles more obtuſe. And the Streets likewiſe may the better be direct and ſtrait, which is a main matter towards the defence of a Town of War; by reaſon that they may be the better tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with Trenches and Barricadoes upon all occaſions. And thus much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Works due unto a Fort, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Town, both regular and irregular. It remaineth to ſay ſomewhat of the

               </head>
               <p>TOuching the Ports of a Town of War (not to ſpeak any thing of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique ones, juſtly deſpicable) the general modern rule is, That the extremities or points of theſe Works be not extended or thruſt out any way beyond thoſe of the Curtains, leſt by their interpoſition, they hinder the operation of the Artillery, and ſo fruſtrate the defence of them: And that theſe Ports are to be raiſed ſo near unto the Bulworks, that from them they may be defended by Muſquet-ſhot.</p>
               <p>As for the part where theſe Ports are to be made, the famous Engineer <hi>San-Martin</hi> Propoundeth it to be upon the Curtain; their largeneſs to conſiſt of ſix Braces, their height of nine: and that near unto each Port, is to be a Poſtern cut out of the Curtain, in breadth one Brace
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:191816:16"/>and an half before, and three behind: and that the Counter-port ſhould be of five Braces in bredth, and eight in heighth: and between the two Ports, he would have left the covered <hi>Piazza,</hi> or Plain, or Paſſage, to be in breadth one Brace, and in length thirty two; having withal two places ſo framed, as from them to give fire on each ſide upon the firſt Gate: and on each ſide of this paſſage to be three ſquare Rooms below, of eight Braces on a ſide, wherein to lodge the Souldiers of the Guard; and as many above, directly over them, to be paſſed up into by two Ladders or Stairs; the one Stair on the one ſide, and the other on the other, upon thoſe ſides of them which lie within, and towards the Town and the Guard thereof: and ſo the whole piece become a perfect Square, upon the flat top of which, he would have a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to be raiſed, to be paſſed up unto by two other pair of Stairs in the Flanks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Curtains.</p>
               <p>Thus propoundeth the great Engineer, <hi>San-Martin</hi> or <hi>San Mariano.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, if the heighth of theſe Works be adviſedly conſidered by this preſcription, I ſee not (howſoever the Front may make
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:191816:17"/>a gallant Proſpect) but it muſt needs carry wich it very much of peril, and lie open to a Batterie, by reaſon of the heighth. And therefore I am of opinion, that theſe Ports with their ſeconds, are not to be made upon the very Curtains themſelves, but ſomewhat within them; and ſo to make a kind of Ear or Pome unto it, the which may ſo ſtand out before the Port, as to hinder the Enemie from beating upon it with his Guns, and withal offend ſuch of the Enemie as ſhall approach behind the ſhoulder: and likewiſe it ſhall hereby play very freely upon that ſide of the Bulwork which is next unto it, and upon the boſom or bowing of the foreſaid Ear, Pome, or Guard of the ſhoulder that flankers it.</p>
               <p>True it is, that the way or paſſage which leadeth from the Port into the Town, is to be (for a good way) ſomewhat extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary large, and withal with ſuch a bending, that two pieces of Batterie, at the leaſt, may directly and fully beat upon the Port it ſelf: to which end all the whole paſſage is to be kept clear from all impediments of houſes, or any thing elſe that may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the play of theſe Ordnance.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FRom theſe Ports we have occaſion to obſerve ſomewhat touching ſuch Forts and Citadels as anciently, and in many places to this day, are raiſed and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome Towns of War; and ſerve as well to defend the place againſt an aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy, as to hold the Town it ſelf in a we and order.</p>
               <p>Now to this purpoſe, the antique uſe was to ſeat the Citadels in the midſt of the Town, upon ſome high and elevated part: and if none ſuch was there to be found, then to raiſe them in any other part, beſt tending that way.</p>
               <p>The more modern practice hath been, and is, to erect theſe Citadels in ſuch a poſture, and in ſuch a part, that the one half of them might be within the Walls of the Town, the other half without, as the ſituation would bear. And this was principally done, that ſupplies might be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:191816:18"/>brought in or out unto the Citadel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in danger to be hindred by the Town, if it ſhould happen to be impatro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized either by Rebels or by an Enemie. But this way hath not paſſed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, becauſe the part without the Walls may be ſo ruined either by Battery or Mine, that the part within ſhall not be able to put into it any ſufficient ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
               <p>It's my opinion therefore that Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels within Towns of War are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſited, when they ſtand upon the moſt eminent and elevated part, and if it may be, upon the very Walls of the Town, and ſo ſerve in the nature of a Bulwork alſo, to guard and flanker the Curtains of the Wall on each ſide; but yet ſo, as not to be offended by the over-vicinity of any of the Bulworks; and that they be contrived with one or more ſecret Poſterns, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and cloſe Avenues, that Munition and Men may at all times be conveyed into them; and that every way they have a full command upon the Town wherein they ſtand, and be able eſpecially to beat upon ſuch parts thereof as are moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and eſpecially the Market-place
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:191816:18"/>and Ports; ſo that if the Town ſhould chance to be ſurpriſed by an Enemie, or turn Rebel, it may not onely be battered by the Fort, but the parts thereof diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and means and commoditie afforded for the receipt of all ſuch ſupplies as may be intended for the regaining of the Town.</p>
               <p>As for the Forms of theſe Citadels, howſoever the Triangular and Quadrate Forms are diſapprovable in Royal Forts (as formerly was noted) yet in theſe, in regard they are generally but ſmall, they may be allowed to conſiſt of four ſides, and indeed not of above five: yet is their circuits not to be ſo little, but that there may be a ſufficiencie of Retreat upon all occaſions: for otherwiſe they may ſuffer much. As for their Walls, Curtains, and Bulworks, they ought to be (in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſomewhat larger, and their ditches deeper then thoſe of the Town, as ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greater charge, and undergoing the more of danger.</p>
               <p>It is alſo very neceſſary, that within theſe Citadels, Mounts or Cavaliers, be raiſed in the midſt of them, not of ſtone (for theſe may not onely be eaſily ruined
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:191816:19"/>by an Enemies Counter-battery, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prove dangerous to the defendants in Guard near at hand,) but of good earth: the top of which is to be circled with Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions, or ſolid entrenchments. And thus may the Territory and Champain round about be commanded with the Ordnance mounted upon them, and the Enemie be diſabled from making his approaches but with much moleſtation and danger.</p>
               <p>As for the way to furniſh theſe Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels with water, it muſt be done by Wells or Ciſterns, or both, in convenient places. And for their Arms, Victuals, and Powder, Caves and well-ſecured parts muſt be framed, wherein to ſtore them: and eſpecially for their Powder, that it may be ſo diſtributed and repartited, that it be not either by chance or treachery fired all at once. But of this more ſhall be preſcribed in another place. Now the benefit and aſſiſtance that have been found by theſe kind of Citadels, was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced in that of the <hi>Campi doglio</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which recovered that Citie from the <hi>Gauls:</hi> In that of <hi>Tarento,</hi> which held out five years after the taking of the Town, and was the means of reducing it.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:191816:19"/>And of late in an Action of our own in the journey to the Iſland of <hi>Rey,</hi> where the Citadel of the Town of S. <hi>Martins,</hi> (though it lay without the Town, becauſe the Town was unwalled) after we had been poſſeſſed of the Town and whole Iſland, for three months ſpace, by its hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt us, put us to a Retreat, with the loſs of our coſt and labour, and the lives of ſome of our beſt men.</p>

Of which, in raiſing the Baſtions or Scarps, one fagot is to be laid in every three foot of ground, and ſo thoroughout the whole Work: only the Front of the Work is to be made up with good Turf,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:191816:20"/>with the Green ſide outwards, and to be well lined with bruſh and fagots, with good mold thrown both upon them and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; the which will not onely make it firm, but comely. And where none of this prime earth is to be had, but that onely of the middle ſort, which is part of a firm clay, and part of ſand; then ought there to be provided the greater ſtore of this bruſh and fagots, and mud, or the like ſtuff, to be thrown into the Fagots, and a fagot to be put between every two Turffs of earth.</p>
               <p>But where nothing is to be gotten but meer ſand onely (which is the worſt of all ſorts of earth,) a very great abundance of bruſh and fagots are to be had in readineſs; and the moſt firm and ſtable Turff is to he fetched elſewhere, and to be proportioned into eight Spans in largeneſs, and ſixteen in length. And the rows of Turff are to be doubled the one upon the other, and with great Pins or Dibbles of ſtrong wood, each of them of two foot in length, to be pinned and faſtned together. And every courſe of two Turffs are thus to be pinned; putting withal into every courſe a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtore of fagots filled with ſand: and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:191816:20"/>in the face of all, ſome of the beſt earth is again to be laid to the thickneſs of four Spans, that ſo this earth may be ſcarped by little and little, to cauſe the VVork to ſhew fair; two Scarps being to be made between every five foot of ground, always mingling withal, within and near unto the firm earth, ſome Straw, or Mud, or the like ſtuff.</p>
               <p>And indeed theſe fagots or bruſh, are the moſt principal materials, as well for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in Cities, as in all approaches upon them: neither, to ſay truth, can any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences at all be ſuddenly raiſed by any means without them, nor any half Moons, or the like; ſo that it may well be ſaid, <hi>Want Fagots, want Defences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is evidenced in no part more, then in the Low-Country-VVars, where moſt of their deſigns reflect upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and keeping of ſtrong Towns, and where all, both defences and approaches are chiefly made up with theſe fagots: witneſs above all others, the laſt famous Siege of the <hi>Borſe,</hi> where the expence in theſe kinds alone, was on the Aſſailants part infinite great, and the effects no leſs admirable.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of Guns in a Town of War: Where beſt to be placed.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving gone thus far in the point of Forts and Fortifyings of Towns of VVar, we are to give ſome advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about the Artillery and Guns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing and due unto them.</p>
               <p>It is the general opinion, that in a Town of VVar of the true ſize, which (as before ſaid) is to be in the diameter betwixt three and four hundred paces, there are not to be fewer then ſixty pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which are thus qualified: Of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons twelve, ſhooting forty pounds of iron, which are to be imployed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Batteries. Of Demy-cannons eighteen, ſhooting twenty four pounds of iron, for the defeat of the Enemies defences and trenches. Of thoſe called by the French, Quarts du Cannons, ſhooting ten pounds of iron, wherewith to offend the Enemie in his approaches, and to endanger his Sentinels and Out-watches. Of Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces twenty, ſhooting five pounds of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:191816:21"/>iron, or ſeven and a half of lead; to be imployed not onely upon the Walls and Ramparts, but upon the entries of Breaches: and beſides all theſe, three Morter-pieces at the leaſt, for the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Granadoes and Fire-works into the Enemies Trenches, and to give light in the night-time, for diſcoverie of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Works.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Repartitions of the great Guns, accounted requiſite for the defence of a well-fortified Town: wherein I ſhall onely adviſe to change the twelve whole Cannons for ſo many half ones. And my reaſons are, firſt, becauſe they are more manageable: ſecondly, in that they may the oftner, and with more eaſe, be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, diſcharged, and recharged: thirdly, in regard that they do not over-ſhake their Walls and Works, as Cannons do: and laſtly, in that they exact not ſo many hands to manage them, nor require ſo great expence of Powder as the other.</p>
               <p>As for the parts and particular places where theſe great Guns are to be lodged, and eſpecially during the time of a Siege; the Rules are, that if the Enemie plant his Batteries againſt the Curtains of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:191816:22"/>VVall, the Guns in the Town are to be mounted upon the Bulworks next unto that Curtain where the Enemie batters: lodging withall ſome few Pieces upon the inmoſt brink of the ditch which flankers with the breach. But in this point, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care is to be taken, that theſe Pieces, as well on the Baſtion as Ditch, be never ſuffered to play, ſave when the Enemie preſents himſelf in multitudes to force the breach, that ſo they may lie undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>But if the Enemie batters upon the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, then the neck of the Baſtion is to be cut and retrenched; and within this retrenchment ſome great Guns are to be laid, and with good ſhoulders to be well covered and ſhadowed, until the Enemie adventures to force the breach, and then to be thorowly imployed on the ſudden. And this retrenchment may alſo be uſed in defence of the Curtains, if there be a void place for the making of a half Moon, or the like piece of VVork. And thus are the great Guns to be lodged and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a well-fortified Town of VVar.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HAving thus far diſcourſed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VVorks of a Town of VVar, we ſhall now advertiſe ſomewhat alſo of the Out-works.</p>
               <p>And firſt of the Moat or Ditch, which lieth the next without the Town-VVall; and is ſometimes in ſome places without water, ſometimes filled with water; and again: ſometimes filled with a ſtanding water, ſometimes with a current.</p>
               <p>Now of theſe particulars, as alſo of the breadth of the Ditch, ſome diſputes have been which ſhould be the beſt. Of which (as affecting brevity) I ſhall onely ſay, That the drie Ditch may be fitteſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the VVorks that may be made in it; and the wet, in regard of retarding and troubling of an Enemie, and forcing of him to fill it up, or to lay Galleries o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Out-work without the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:191816:23"/>VValls, are the Ravelins; and theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are cut out triangle-wiſe, and are raiſed for the moſt part, in the middle of the Ditch, and ſerve as well to defend and ſcowre the Ditch, as alſo in the nature of Caſemates.</p>
               <p>The third VVork without-dores, is that called the Counter-Scarp; and it is a kinde of Breſt-work, cut enclining by little and little downwards, and ſited on the outmoſt ſhore or ſide of the Ditch: and it ſerves for the ſafety of Muſquetiers.</p>
               <p>The fourth VVork of this nature, is termed a Horn-work; and it is contrived to ſecure and ſcowre the Curtains of the Counter-Scarp. And it takes the name, by having their corners of the Fronts ſhaped like a Fork, or two Horns joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, before theſe Horn-works are again cut out certain places of a ſafe Retreat, called Half Moons; and theſe are alſo fortified with a Counter-Scarp about one Cubit in heighth. And into theſe Half Moons are paſſages cut out for the Souldiers to go from the Front of the Horn-work behinde them, over little Draw-bridges thrown over their Ditches.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:191816:23"/>
               <p>And theſe are the chief and prime of all thoſe Pieces termed Out-works; which, to ſpeak truly, are rather the Repairs and Succours of faultie Pieces of Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then any true ones themſelves. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all which in general, and eſpecial care is to be had, that both the outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VVorks of a true fortified place, be ſo contrived, and ſo correſpond one to another, that ſome of them lying higher then others, and others again in an equal heighth, they may with the more ſurety defend each other from the Flanks, and from above: ſo that from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the next to it, and from thence to the reſt, there may be a ſafe retreat for the Defendants upon all occaſions.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Ways of Defence, by Protraction, Fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Batteries, Mines, Aſſaults, how to make void. Defence of Towns by way of Sallies. How to carry off a Gariſon out of a Sea-Town.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE ſhall now propound ſome courſes of defence by way of Protraction, and others by way of Fruſtration; whereby a beſieged place may haply preſerve it ſelf againſt expugnation.</p>
               <p>Now the courſes by Protraction, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the raiſing of ſome ſmall Forts, or by Counter-approaches, or Sallies. The Forts to this purpoſe are to be raiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Muſquet-ſhot of the Town, whoſe Ditches are to be emboqued from the Flanks of the Bulwork, or at the leaſt from ſome part of the Curtain, from which alſo the platforms of the Forts are to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered; that if the Enemy ſhould gain them, he may as ſuddenly be beaten out, and diſabled from maintaining them. The Counter-approaches are to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boqued from the Flanks, and to begin at
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:191816:24"/>the Counter-Scarp, and ſo to be carried towards the Enemies approaches. And the uſe of theſe are, both to delay the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in his approaches, and to lodge Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in; from whence they may aid the Defendants in their Sallies. And the one part of the earth taken out of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-approaches, is to be caſt up towards the Enemies VVorks; and the reſt to be carried into the Town for Munition-earth.</p>
               <p>As for Sallies, whenſoever they are to be practiſed by night, a ſure courſe is to be taken that intelligence be gotten how the Enemie is lodged, that they may be brought on accordingly: if they be to be made by day, it muſt always be done upon a ſure advantage, and a ſtrict injunction that they paſs not beyond the diſtance of a Reſerve to be given them by the ſhot of the Town. And thus by theſe Sallies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly made, the carrying of Galleries and Traverſes intended by the Enemie, may be hindred from being brought over the Ditch. And the like may alſo be done by Counter-mines, if the Ditch be drie; and by throwing into it combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as Fire-works, and the like. And if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:191816:25"/>the Ditch be wet, proviſion muſt be made of Boats and Floats, for the better condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of theſe Sallies whenſoever they are made. And theſe are the courſes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of Fruſtration, are performed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by making void the Enemies Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or his Mines, or his Aſſaults.</p>
               <p>His Batteries may be made void either by a Counter-batterie, which may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount his Guns, ſpoil their Carriages, or ruine their Gabions: Or by a repair of the breaches made by the Enemies Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; to which end, ſtore of Timber, Pales, Faggots, Hurdles, and Munition-earth, are to be provided: Or by carrying the earth into the Town which falleth from the Batterie, that it remain not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Ditch, or increaſe the Scarp.</p>
               <p>The Enemies Mines may be fruſtrated, either by Counter-mines, or by Batteries from the oppoſite Flank, or by wetting of the Powder in the bed of the Mine, or by giving vent unto the Mine. And ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe may be done when the place of the Mine is diſcovered; and it may be diſcovered by the uſe of a long Piercer, ſuch as are commonly uſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:191816:25"/>and ſearch after Cole-mines.</p>
               <p>The Enemies Aſſaults (though they cannot be abſolutely reſtrained) yet may be ſuſtained either by the Cannon ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Flank, and fully re-guarding the breach, being continually well plyed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of the aſſault; or by a Counter-Mure, whoſe platform ought to be ſtreight, and the Flanks ſo contrived that one may not endamage the other: Or by Mines as well in the ditch as plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of the Counter-Mure, and which may be covered with boards full of nails: Or by continual throwing of Granadoes, Stones, Timber, artificial fires, and the like combuſtible matter.</p>
               <p>And if any place of ſtrength, as Town or Fort, ſhall happen to be ſo aſſaulted and ſtormed, as that neither hope of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward defence remains, nor hope of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in this deſperate condition, if a Sally be made out of divers Ports at once, and that unexpectedly and thorowly brought on, and well followed; it hath been found not onely to mitigate the heat and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the aſſault, and control the fury of the Enemy, the better to obtain reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Souldier-like conditions and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:191816:26"/>Quarter; but alſo quite to alter the face of the day, and abſolutely to occaſion the quitting of the Siege.</p>
               <p>And hereof we have a punctual exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Commentaries, where <hi>Sergius Galba</hi> (being ſent to make good a certain paſſage of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and to that purpoſe reſolving to winter in the part) was ſuddenly beſieged, and aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſtanding Camp, by the native in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and being ſo over-preſſed with multitude, that no hope of longer defence remained, by the advice of <hi>Caius Voluſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the beſieged <hi>Romans</hi> brake out tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all the gates of the aſſaulted Camp, on ſuch a ſudden, and with ſuch a courage and alacrity, that they gave the aſſailing Enemy no leiſure to conſider of what was done, nor to ſatisfie their judgments and apprehenſions upon ſo unexpected a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo that the face of all things being ſuddenly changed, the <hi>Romans</hi> (ſaith the Story) found the means to ſlay more then the third part of thirty thouſand men, and abſolutely routed all the reſt. And if a Garriſon or Army being beſieged in a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-Town, the Port being open to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſhall be ſo forced upon by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:191816:26"/>Enemy, as that the place muſt needs be forſaken; the ſafeſt courſe to do this, conſiſteth in ſome Works to be made within the Town: and theſe Works may be of three ſorts; either by Muring and Barricadoing up the Entrances and ends of the Streets and Lanes which might give acceſs to the Enemie; or by ſinking ſome Ditches or Trenches croſs thoſe ways and paſſages, which may alſo be ſtuck full of ſharp ſtakes and calthrops, covered and ſhadowed over with light and thin hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, that the aſſailing Enemie may not heed them; or to hedge in all ſuch Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues as lead unto the Port, with a ſtrong <hi>Pallizado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the courſe of conveyance of the Souldiers out of the Town to Ship-board, it muſt be carried with as little ſhew of fear as may be; and by the ſtay and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome of the lighteſt armed men here and there upon the Walls and Bulworks, to make a ſemblance of a longer holding out of the place; and that the Enemie may take no notice of the leaſt intention of a retreat. And theſe laſt reſerve of men, are to be called off upon the giving of a word, after the reſt of the army are embarqued, without noiſe or tumult.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:191816:27"/>
               <p>And of this alſo we find a preſident du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Civil VVars between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> who being beſieged by <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Brundiſium,</hi> punctually practiſed this courſe, and ſafely ſhipped all the remainder of his forces into <hi>Greece,</hi> where moſt of his Legions were before. And this he did without loſs or trouble, although <hi>Caeſar</hi> did his beſt to prevent it.</p>
               <p>And ſurely had we done the like at the Iſſe of <hi>Rey,</hi> and in this manner ſhipped our men at the Town of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> and not marched over into the ſmall Iſland of <hi>Loiz</hi> by Land, in all likelyhood we had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that blow, and had come more fairly off in that our unluckie deſcent.</p>

Of approaches upon a beſieged Town. Of Galleries uſed in Sieges, Batteries, how to be made and preſerved.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ANd thus having ſpoken ſomewhat of all the ways and practices Defenſive in a VVar, we ſhall now do the ſame touching the courſes of Offence.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, this ought to be received as a Maxime, that whoſoever intendeth to expugn any place whatſoever, is to be at that preſent, in that part, Maſter of the Field: he ought alſo to be well informed of the ſituation, ſtrength and proviſions of all kindes, wherewith the place he means to beſiege is furniſhed. As in particular, with what kindes of Ordinance, and how many; with what quantitie of Proviſions, as well for defence as in point of Victual. A true and perfect deſignation is likewiſe to be procured of the VValls, Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:191816:28"/>Bulworks, and Baſtions; of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and weakeſt parts of the place, as alſo of the moſt Minable and Unminable parts. And if he aim to attempt it by ſurprize, that it be reſolved with judgment, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with diligence and reſolution: and in particular, if by way of Eſcalade or Scaling, either by day or night, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect information be gotten of the quality of the Ditch; as, whether it be filled with a ſtanding water, or a currant; whether it have a Counter-Scarp or not, on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt ſide. If it have a Counter-Scarp, and the water in the Ditch be a current, the courſe by way of an Eſcalade may be, by the proviſion of a dozen of light brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made with two poles of Pine, or ſome other light wood, to the length of fifteen or twenty foot, and the thickneſs of a mans thigh; upon which poles, traverſe pieces of planks are to be faſtned a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wide aſunder, Ladderwiſe, and to be in largeneſs about three foot. At the ends of which Ladder or Bridge, as well before as behind, two ſtrong cords are to be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; that by them, when the Bridges or Ladders are thrown over the water of the Ditch, they may be drawn back at pleaſure.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:191816:28"/>
               <p>Theſe Bridges thus fitted, may each of them be carried by ſix men: and being brought to the ſide of the Ditch, and ſet down upon the water, four or ſix Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are to beſtow themſelves upon each bridge, ſuſtaining themſelves upon their Pikes, and ſo to paſs over the Moat. Theſe men being thus gotten over, they are to thruſt back the Bridges, holding the ends of the cords which are next unto them, and giving room and a length of cord for the bridges to paſs over, that ſo they may reach to the other outward ſide. The which being done, four or five Souldiers more are (as formerly) to paſs upon each bridge; and thoſe Souldiers that were firſt over, are to draw theſe bridges up unto them. And thus to continue doing, until there be ſo many Souldiers paſt over as the place is capable to receive, or ſhall be held ſufficient to carry the Town.</p>
               <p>This being done, theſe bridges are to be drawn up out of the Ditch by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that have paſſed over, and are to ſerve in the nature of Ladders for the ſcaling of the Wall. And becauſe they may perchance prove too ſhort for the heighth of the Wall, it is a neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:191816:29"/>to have for every one of theſe bridges a ſmaller Ladder, not fully ſo broad as the Bridge-ladders themſelves; the which may be enchaſed and made faſt unto them by their ſteps, and ſo the want of height in the bridges ſupplied.</p>
               <p>It is good providence alſo to provide ſome Ladders of cords with ſtrong hooks of iron at their ends; the which hooks by throwing, are to be latched to the top of the Wall.</p>
               <p>But theſe are not ſo much to be truſted upon, as the former Ladders, in regard that they may be often thrown up, before they faſten. And theſe are the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and ſecure courſes to be practiſed in Eſcalades. Many others there are of this nature, which are to be varied, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to occaſion and opportunity, to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But if a Surprize be intended by the uſe of a Petard, one approved courſe may be, by faſtning the Petard to the end of the Maſt of a ſhip, much after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that ſmall barrels of Guns are laid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtocks of wood. At the other end of which Maſt is to be hung a weight coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſing the Petard, that ſo it may be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:191816:29"/>directed and moved in a ſtraight line. And in the midſt of the Maſt are certain wheels to be faſtned, equal to the wheels of the Carriage of a Cannon. Behinde theſe wheels, when the Petard is brought to the part where it is to do execution, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments are to be laid to prevent all reverſe. And it is to be brought up as cloſe to the place where it is to work, as poſſibly may be. And againſt the time of giving fire to the Petard, proviſion muſt be made of a Draw-bridge, to ſupply the place of a Draw-bridge belonging to the Town that is to be attempted, if it ſhould be broken down, or drawn up.</p>
               <p>And thus much onely touching ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts as are to be made upon a Town of War, by way of Surpriſe. But if this be to be done by encampings, obſervation is to be made, that the Army be lodged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched with ſuch judgment, that the Quarters on all ſides, and at all times, ſecure and ſecond one another; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al be ſo well united, that they may both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Enemie in <hi>Campagnia</hi> (if he ſhall offer to fall on that way) and to maintain themſelves withal againſt the beſieged Town. As for the approaches upon the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:191816:30"/>Town it ſelf, they are to be begun ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beyond the diſtance of Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot from the Towns Wall (except the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the place afford other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) and from thence are to be carryed forwards to the Ditch, and then thorow the Ditch to the face of the Bulwork: and rather to the Bulwork then the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, (eſpecially if the beſieged Town be any thing large) becauſe the Curtains are guarded with more then one Flanker, whereas the Bulwork is onely with one.</p>
               <p>And in the making of theſe approaches, theſe particulars that follow are always to be obſerved. Firſt, That all the earth taken out of the Trenches be thrown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Town beſieged. Secondly, That theſe Trenches lie not open to any part of the Town, either in Front or Flank. And this to be done by carrying of the Lines of the approaches fully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the points of the Bulwork toward which it is to be approached; and withal, by making them deep below the line to ſix foot, and not broader in the bottom then to twenty foot. Thirdly, That all theſe approaches flank one another; which is done by making of many Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:191816:30"/>
                  <hi>(al le Forbici)</hi> every one of them being to be to the length of thirty or forty paces. Fourthly, That every Trench be provided with ſome ſmall Works for the lodging of a <hi>Corps du Gard;</hi> and theſe are to be caſt up at the ends and mid-parts of the Trenches. Fifthly, That at the head of every approach, a ſmall Fort be contrived capable to lodge ſo many Souldiers as may repulſe any Sally. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the Angles of the Trenches be deeper then the reſt of them, ſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from being diſcovered from any part of the Town. Seventhly, That the cutting into the Counter-Scarp be under ground, and not directly embocqued with any part of the Wall. Eighthly, That thoſe approaches which be carried thorow the Ditch to the Wall, be made of matter incombuſtible; and withal, be of force to reſiſt any batterie from the Flank which regardeth them. And this is to be done by Traverſes if the Ditch be drie, and by Galleries if it be wet.</p>
               <p>And theſe Galleries are to be reduced into members or parts, that ſo the more eaſily they may be carried from place to place; and to be rejoyned when they are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:191816:31"/>to be uſed; and then to be covered with fagots and earth, or with mats made and kept wet, that the Enemie may not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger them by Fire-works. And theſe Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may be larger or leſſer, as cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, carrying the heighth of nine feet, and the bredth of ſix: though true it is, that the larger they are, the better they are, as admitting a freer paſſage for men, be they either Souldiers or Pioneers.</p>
               <p>Now whilſt theſe approaches are thus in action, Batteries are to be raiſed and planted: to perfect which, reſpect is to be had of their ſecurity, their execution, their form, and the expedition. Batteries may be ſecured againſt the ſhot from the Town by Gabions, ſeven foot high and ſix foot broad, filled with ſolid earth well trodden: and againſt Sallies, by Trenches well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Souldiers to repel the Enemy. Batteries may prove defective in their execution, both by being over-remote, and by the manner of mounting of the Guns. The diſtance therefore from the part to be beaten upon, is not to be above two hundred paces, nor nearer then one hundred: for when they are within the one, or without the other, the ball loſeth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:191816:31"/>of its beſt force. As for the forms of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, the Guns are beſt mounted when they may ſtand parallel with the Batterie: becauſe when they are under the horizon, the ball affecteth its natural repoſe; when above, it ſuffereth violence. As for the form of the body of the Batterie, the moſt proper is that of a half Moon; prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all others, in regard that it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wider, flanketh better, and requireth fewer Gabions then any other form. Touching expedition in point of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, the apteſt courſe is, for the Maſter or General of the Artillery to make uſe of a ſufficient number of Cannoneers for the attending upon the Batterie: and the Work it ſelf is much forwarded by a Trench caſt ten foot before the front of the Batterie, where the Souldiers may be lodged and ſhrowded from the Enemie; and withal it will ſerve for the traverſe of the Guns.</p>
               <p>But all this, though never ſo throughly obſerved, proves defective in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of making an aſſaultable breach, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of Mines or Mining: for though the uſe of Mines at the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of great Guns, was for a time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:191816:32"/>yet hath the practice of them been revived, by reaſon of the perfection of modern Fortification; the which by occular demonſtration hath evidenced, that Artillery is not otherwiſe profitable for expugnation, then onely to take away Defences. And therefore in this enſuing Chapter we ſhall advertiſe ſomewhat of them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN the uſe of a Mine there is nothing more to be ſuſpected, nor more peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then a Counter-mine from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: to avoid which, the way whereby it may be done, is to be declined, either on the one ſide or other, as occaſion and the ſite of the place will ſuffer.</p>
               <p>A Mine therefore is not to be carried in a right line, but courbed and crooked. And the ſides thereof are in many places to be bored with long and fit Piercers of iron, that ſo the Enemies Counter-mining
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:191816:32"/>may be heard; which cannot be ſo cloſely nor ſecretly wrought upon, but by this means may be diſcovered and heard. In the carrying likewiſe of a well-contrived Mine, an eſpecial care is to be taken againſt the ſinking and falling down of the earth from above, whereby the Miners may be buried: to prevent which, it is to be well fourred or underpropped with pieces or pillars of Timber, ſeven foot high if the part will bear it: and the breadth of the Mine is to be five foot, ſided with planks and roofed with boards. And if the ground be found over-moiſt, and ſtored with Springs of water, it is alſo to be floored with boards, leaving a ſmall Trench for the water to paſs away, or digging ſome ſmall Wells to the ſame intent.</p>
               <p>The Mine being thus, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conducted to the deſtinated part, where it is to do execution; a bed or chamber is to be framed for the receipt of the powder: the which being lodged in it to a ſufficiencie, is to be very carefully cloſed up, that no air may enter, ſave only at that ſmall hole through which the train of Powder is to paſs into the chamber or bed of the Mine, whereby the whole maſs
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:191816:33"/>of Powder may be fired at the time when it is to do execution. And it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the nearer the paſſage or tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-fare of the Mine approacheth to the Chamber, the narrower it ought to be: ſo that though at the mouth of the Mine it may be ſeven foot high and five foot broad; and at the half way, five foot high and four foot broad; yet at the very chamber it ought not to be larger then onely for the entrance of the barrels of Powder to be put in one after another. But above all things, an eſpecial care is to be had by the Conductor of the Mine, that before he begin his work, he be very attentive and diligent in taking the exact diſtance that is to be between the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, and the end; with the preciſe conſideration of all its winding and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes, that ſo he may be ſure of the right placing of the bed of the Mine, under the part upon which it is to do execution; leſt otherwiſe, not onely the whole labour and coſt be loſt, but prove prejudicial to his own partie. To which end alſo, the declination or ſloping of the chamber or bed, is to be made parallel to the Scarp of the Wall: for if it decline either more or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:191816:33"/>leſs then the Scarp, it will there break forth, becauſe it ſhall there finde the leaſt reſiſtance; and ſo in ſtead of an aſſaulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breach, make only a ſmall hole in the Rampart. And thus far touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Mines, and the firing of them.</p>

               <p>THe Mine being thus fitted and fired, (before any aſſault be offered or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted) the breach is to be viewed, and judged whether it be aſſaultable or no; and all the Defences are to be taken away, both in Front and Flank. And this is to be done by planting the Cannons in ſuch a manner, that they may thorowly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and hereby the Aſſailants put upon the breach with the better ſecurity and hope of ſucceſs, as well in reſpect of themſelves, as of their Seconds and Thirds, if need be.</p>
               <p>As for the ordering of the Souldiers which are to aſſault; ſome appoint the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:191816:34"/>armed men to be flanked with the ſhot; others put the ſhot in the Front and Rear of the armed men. But for mine own part, I conceive the moſt approved order to be, that the armed men be flanked with ſhot; onely placing ſome three or four ranks of ſhot in their Front, the better to give fire continually upon the breach, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the armed men have recovered the top of it: And during the whole time of the aſſault, all the Trenches to be furniſhed with the very beſt of the ſhot, who are to beat the Enemie from their Parapet, that they may not give any aid to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants in Flank: And the whole Camp beſides to be in Arms, both Horſe and Foot; as well for the more terrour to the Defendants, as for the intercepting of the Enemie upon all occaſions and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
               <p>And if it fall out that in the aſſault of the Breach the Ditch cannot be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently paſſed over by the way of Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (formerly deſcribed) the moſt proper courſe in ſtead of them may be, after the Breach is thoroughly made, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches under the covert of the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches brought to the brink of the Ditch,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:191816:34"/>to fill up the ſaid Ditch with earth and fagots; towards which alſo the ruines and rubbiſh of the Wall made by the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie will much conduce: neither is there any Moat of ſtanding water, or Ditch ſo deep, but by this courſe may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted.</p>
               <p>True it is, that ſometimes to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe long and great Trees are thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ditch, covered over, and faſtned together with planks, and ſhadowed on the ſides with Blindes: But this is not held ſo certain as the former, though both of them are in uſe where the Ditch hath in it a ſtanding water. But if the water of the Ditch be a current, and any thing ſwift, then the beſt way is to make a bridge upon a large boat; the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apted and contrived to the breadth of the Ditch, over againſt the Breach, is to have certain Draw-bridges belonging to it, at each end one, ſo fitted, that they may ſerve for Blindes and coverts alſo, to ſhadow ſuch men as are to conduct the bridge. And being thus contrived and manned, it is to be ſuffered to float down with the ſtream from the place where it was firſt framed (which muſt be in a place
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:191816:35"/>freeſt from danger of the Enemie:) and to be moored and made faſt directly upon the breach, that ſo the Draw-bridges for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, being then let fall, the Souldiers which are upon the main bridge may not onely finde a ſufficient and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecured paſſage for themſelves, but for the reſt of the Army alſo, (as many of them as ſhall be thought needful) to aſſault the Breach, and to ſtorm and carry the Town.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEfore we leave this ſubject touching Aſſaults upon Towns and Forts, and the approaches due unto them; and though ſomewhat alſo hath formerly been noted touching Batteries; yet, for the better underſtanding of them every way, it will be neceſſary to add ſomewhat more at large.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:191816:35"/>
               <p>Batteries are Mounts of earth, and their Forms are generally thus contrived: the ſides of the Works toward the Enemy are to be made Cannon-proof, that is, of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five foot in thickneſs: in the Rear and Flank of them they are to have a Wall of fifteen foot thick; onely the one ſide of this Wall is to be thicker then the reſt, as riſing with a Walk and a Parapet on the inſide: in their Front they are to be lined with two exteriour Angles, and their faces to be raiſed with open Windows, or Ports (as they are generally called) tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which the great Guns are to play: on their inſides they are to have a good groundſelling or floor made of Turff, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, or the like; of eight foot in heighth, and in breadth anſwerable to the greatneſs of the whole Work. And this floor is to be covered with planks, for the better tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing and reverſe of the Guns.</p>
               <p>But before the raiſing or planting of any of theſe Batteries, eſpecial obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be taken, whether there be any poſſibility or likelyhood of ſuccour to be brought to the place againſt which this Battery is raiſed: for if there be, then care is to be had, that though the Enemy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:191816:36"/>ſhould give on with a main force, yet the Ordnance upon the Batterie may either be retreated or defended. And this may be probably effected by firming the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery on all ſides, and by ſo blocking up all Avenues, and making of convenient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapets, that the Enemie ſhall not be able to make any other acceſſes, ſave by the very Ports where the Pieces lie. And if the Battery be of neceſſity to be planted upon a Dike, and thereby may be in peril of being drowned; the heighth of the Dike is to be conſidered, and proviſion made accordingly; and a paſſage toward the <hi>Campagnia</hi> to be guarded and kept free, that ſo the Pieces may be carried off that way, if there be no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it is generally neceſſary, and eſpecially in ſome caſes, that the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Batterie be lodged in ſecret, and as much obſcured from the Enemies Cannon in the Town, as poſſibly may be; one eſpecial courſe tending this way, may be practiſed by making a convenient deſcent in the Platform; and that in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Pieces may make their rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſo downwards, as being reverſed may
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:191816:36"/>fully hide themſelves from the Enemies view: and then to be drawn up again by pullies and cords well faſtned to the heads of the Carriages and the Wall of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie aloft.</p>
               <p>True it is, that theſe Guns thus lodged are onely to be imployed upon the very nick of occaſion, and not ordinarily. A ſecond way therefore there is, by making a double Battery, in this manner. Firſt of all, a Battery is to be raiſed with Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Ports, ſufficiently deep, equal, and large, as well before as behinde, in ſuch a faſhion that thorow them the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Cannon may be diſcovered in a right line. This done, another Battery is to be framed, with Ports and Shoulders in a due and anſwerable proportion, ten foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind this; from which through the Ports of the other, the Enemies Pieces may alſo be perfectly ſeen in a right line. And in theſe innermoſt Ports the great Guns are to be mounted: the which nevertheleſs, by reaſon of the foremoſt Batterie, will lie ſo cloſely ſhadowed and hidden, that the Enemy ſhall very hardly diſcover them, or at the leaſt to any hurt or damage.</p>
               <p>A third way to this purpoſe, may be by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:191816:37"/>the choice and laying out of a natural piece of ground; before which a Ditch being ſunk to the depth of eleven foot (which will give a ſufficient defence for the Guns and thoſe that manage them) a ſufficient quantity of ground is to be allowed for the reverſe of the Guns, with the diſtance of twenty foot one from another in their being lodged; having an over-plus of ground behind them, which by the help of Pioneers is ſo to be ſunk, that men may ſafely paſs to and again behind them undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; upon which, planks being arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially laid, the Guns are to be mounted. And laſt of all, Ports are to be cut through the natural earth, to a ſufficiency of large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, depth, and heighth, through which the Ordnance are to play. And this is a Work ſo aſſured, as not to be annoyed or endangered from any part of the Towns Wall, if the earth be firm and ſolid.</p>
               <p>As for the Guns proper for a main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as well in reſpect of number as kindes, they may be thus repartited; eight Cannons, ſix Demy-Cannons, and four Quart du Cannons or Culverins. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtance they are to be lodged in, from the part to be battered, we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:191816:37"/>before. As concerning the ordering of theſe eighteen Pieces upon the Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: The Cannons are to be planted in one Camerade, and to beat and batter in Angle right againſt the Curtain: The ſix Demy-Canons to be divided into two Camerades, on each ſide of the Cannons three, and to beat in Traverſe: The four Culverins are to be imployed for Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to play upon the Enemies Pieces that ſhall be found in flanker of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the Bulworks. For though it be true (as aforeſaid) that where Batteries are to be laid againſt Forts and ſmall Towns, where the Bulworks are near one unto another, it is better to batter upon the Bulworks then the Curtains; yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fortified places of large extent, where the Baſtions or Bulworks are far removed, it is more advantagious to beat upon the Curtains; in regard that the Bulworks are better furniſhed then thoſe Curtains can be: and beſides, the Enemy may better entrench himſelf within the Baſtion then within the Curtain; neither can the Bulworks in large Pieces of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification bring any extraordinary damage at an aſſault, by flanking of the Curtains;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:191816:38"/>by reaſon of their diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. On the contrary, true it is, that in Batteries made againſt Caſtles or Forts, it is ſafeſt to batter upon the Bulworks: for here the Baſtions are ſo neighbouring, and Flank with ſo main a force upon the Curtain, that an aſſault cannot be given without an extraordinary Carnage, and much loſs of Men. And when the Battery is thus upon the Baſtion, the ſame Pieces are ſo to play and batter in Cavalier, or upon the point of the Bulwork, as they did before upon the Curtain.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HAving gone thus far in this way, by the way of Offence, we ſhall now in this Chapter give ſome Advertiſement how a beſieging Army is to defend it ſelf when it expecteth to be aſſaulted by at Enemy, a Friend to the place beſieged, and perhaps Maſter of the Field; which hath
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:191816:38"/>befallen both anciently and modernly. And though it be a caſe of much danger, yet have ſome expert and wiſe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders provided for themſelves and their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to the preſervation of both.</p>
               <p>The Rules and practices conducing hereunto, have been theſe: To entrench ſo ſufficiently againſt the Town beſieged, that no irruptions or Sallies may be made upon them out of the Town, to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſs or danger: That all the Quarters be ſo well fortified in their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, that neither Horſe nor Foot from abroad may make any aſſaults upon them, but with infinite diſadvantage and hazard: That a moſt eſpecial care be taken that the beſieging Army be ſo lodged and encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by ſome commanded Paſſage it may be certainly and ſufficiently ſupplied with Victual, either from ſome of their own neighbouring parts, or ſome other Country to friend: And withal, that the circumjacent Country, through which the Enemies Army is to approach, be as much as poſſibly may be, harried and waſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand; that ſo it may either not be able to victual it at all, or at leaſt very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and that with much hazard and loſs.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:191816:39"/>
               <p>And of this, becauſe Preſidents work much, I ſhall ſet down three: The one ancient, taken out of <hi>Polybius</hi> (in his ninth Book;) which was acted at the Siege of <hi>Capua:</hi> before which the Roman Conſul <hi>Appius</hi> being ſet down, <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſeeking to remove him, (and being by far Maſter of the Field) encloſed the Roman beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Army between himſelf and the Town beſieged; and finding no poſſibility of forcing the Conſul in his Trenches, he practiſed to draw him out to ſome Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes; but failing in both, and wearied with many urging inconveniencies, he was thus forced to march off, and leave him before the Town: by reaſon (ſaith the Author) that the Romans had both ſufficiently victualled themſelves before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and providently ſo waſted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about, before the coming in of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that when they were come they were not able to abide it, through the want of Victual, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Forrage for their Horſe. The Marqueſs <hi>Spinola</hi> preſerved himſelf in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at his Siege of <hi>Breda.</hi> But beyond all others, we have a ſingular Preſident to this purpoſe, in the laſt Siege of the <hi>Borſes</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:191816:39"/>when that Town was taken in by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States: In their ſtupendious Works in the outward Entrenchments, which were no leſs in Circuit then a good days journey; every where fortified with Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, Half Moons, Batteries, and the like: In their diverting of a River from its natural courſe, ſo that the beſieged Town was not only deprived of neceſſary water, but all that part of the Country deeply drowned, whereby the Enemie might have an acceſs to relieve it: In that, to prevent a Relief to the Town by Boats, there was raiſed a firm Cauſey of three miles in length, through ſo waſhy a place, that it was little leſs then a Lake; the which Cauſey was broad enough for two Carts to meet and paſs by one another; with foot-paths beſides, on each ſide, and every where ſtrengthened with Sconces, Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Horn-works, all of Earth: And laſtly, in that (which made it fulleſt of wonder) this world of Earth and Fagots was brought in Boats from a part at the leaſt two or three miles diſtant.</p>
               <p>And yet all theſe were the Works onely (as one may ſay) without dores. As for thoſe within, they were the particular
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:191816:40"/>Breſt-works, and the ſtrengthening of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Quarter: The Trenches that firſt led to the Enemies Sconces without the Town; and after they were taken in, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Town-ditch: The Galleries that were laid over the Ditch: And the Mines which were brought under the Wall. So that although the Enemie marched towards us with a very potent army, and every way very well provided, yet durſt he not (indeed could not) do any thing to any purpoſe, ſave onely look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as we lay in our Works: but was forced to let fall that important Piece into the hands of ſuch an Enemy, that well knows both how to keep it and make uſe of it.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:191816:41"/>if upon the firing there remain any moiſt white ſubſtance ſomewhat blewiſh, it is a ſign that the Brimſtone is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently purified, wherewith that Powder is mixed: if there remain any grains of an earthly colour, it is an evidence that it was not well grounded nor cleanſed: if there be whitiſh grains, it is a ſign that the Salt-Peter is too ſalt, and neither well grounded nor purified: if there be ſeen any reddiſh or tawnyiſh grains, it is a token that the Coals were not well prepared: if Powder (ſome ſmall quantity) being laid upon ones hand, and there fired, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not the hand at all, or very little, but reſult with a ſmall noiſe or puff, it is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſign of excellent good powder. As for the ways of trial without fire: if Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being bitten by ones teeth, taſte mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately ſalt, it is a tolerable token of its goodneſs: if it be of colour not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>black nor obſcure, but ſomewhat tending to a red, it is a very good evidence of good Powder.</p>
               <p>As touching the ſafe laying of it up: It is a moſt-neceſſary providence for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Powder for the uſe of an Army in action, that it be diſpoſed into two or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:191816:41"/>three ſeveral places, and many Magazines, the better to avoid the danger as well of caſual fires, as treaſons, and the Enemies ſurprizes.</p>
               <p>And for the ſafe keeping and certain ſecurity of it in Towns, and eſpecially where mighty Magazines are to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it was the practiſe of a wiſe Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, to lay up the ſeveral materials and ingredients in ſeveral parcels; as the Salt-Peter by it ſelf, the Brimſtone by it ſelf, and the Cole by it ſelf; the which upon all occaſions might ſuddenly be fitted for preſent uſe: And in the mean time, all the hazards and miſchiefs that might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe enſue, be abſolutely preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Powder. As for that of Victual, it is obvious to every judgment, that it muſt be provided according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Army, and the length of the March, and the nature and condition of the Country that the Army is to paſs thorow. I ſhall therefore ſpeak onely of the courſe of conducting it, and of thoſe kinde of people that are to ſell it, termed Sucklers.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:191816:42"/>
               <p>For the order of conduction of Victuals to or for an Army, (eſpecially when there is peril of being charged by an Enemie upon the way) command is to be given, that all the diſordered multitude of Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Waggons wherein the Victuals and the like Baggage is to be carried, be put in equipage either before day, or very early in the morning of that day wherein they are to march. And in the firſt place, ſome Troops of Horſe are to be ſent out to diſcover upon all the Advennes of the Enemy: and for the better ſafe-guard, the Artillery appointed for their guard may be uſefully placed both in the Van of theſe Carriages, and in their Rear; and that not onely to beat upon the Enemie if he ſhall approach by any of thoſe ways, but by their thundering to give notice which way the Enemie comes; that ſo the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers may take a general Alarm, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former direction repair to the part that ſhall moſt require aſſiſtance. Both ſides of the ways alſo where the Carts of Proviſions are to paſs, are to be guarded with looſe Wings of Horſe, and with them ſome numbers of Muſqueteers may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly intermixed, and the beſt of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:191816:42"/>the Horſe may bring up the Rear. And in this manner may the Carriages march, and be ready to receive any Charge. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is likewiſe to be uſed, that ſuch ways of March (as much as may be) be made choice of, as are leaſt ſubject to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhments; and that whenſoever they are to come to blows, it may be in places of advantage. To which end, either Altes are to be made, or a quick March to be practiſed, as cauſe requires. And to this purpoſe alſo, good uſe may be made of Waggons in ſtead of a Trench, drawing the Souldiers within them when a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Charge is attempted by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
               <p>As for the prime Conductor of theſe Victuallers and Victual, he is to be the firſt man out of the Quarter, when theſe Troops are to march, and to make a ſtand, and to take a view of them all, and to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten them forwards. And when they are well-near all paſſed by, he is to march in the Rear of all, though now and then he may advance before into ſuch parts as he conceives may moſt require his preſence; but ought to be the laſt man that takes up his Quarter. He is alſo to obſerve that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:191816:43"/>all the Carriages and the Souldiers of that guard be quartered before the dark of the night; that ſo whileſt there is yet ſome day-light, he may ride round about the Quarter to ſee that all things be ſure.</p>
               <p>Care is likewiſe to be had (if poſſibly it may be) that intelligence be gotten from the inhabitant Peaſants, as well of the Ways, as of the Enemie; and that as well for conveniency as ſafety. To which end all Bridges and Paſſages are to be known, poſſeſt, and guarded. Spies alſo are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to be employed, to gain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to give notice of the Enemies deſigns. And Centinels in the night-time to be placed upon all Avenues. And if an extraordinary ſtrength be expected to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, it will be neceſſary to raiſe ſome Redoubts and Forts upon the Ways and Paſſages, and upon all places where an Enemie may oportunely give on.</p>
               <p>Touching the Victuallers or Sucklers, and Merchants and Artificers which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an Army; they are not any of them to bring any of their Commodities or Merchandiſe into the Camp, without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from the General; who is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to have them well viewed, leſt their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:191816:43"/>Victuals ſhould be corrupt, and infect the Souldiers with ſickneſs; and their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe ſophiſticated, and the Souldier cheated and abuſed. Nor are theſe men to ſell any of their Commodities but in that part and place where the Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter-General ſhall appoint, leſt diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders grow in the Quarters; nor there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but at ſuch times, and at ſuch a rate, as ſhall be allowed by the Provoſt-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall-General, that ſo there may be no extortion upon the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>And if any of theſe ſhall be found De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents in any of theſe kindes, he is to incur the penalty of Impriſonment and Confiſcation of his goods. And if he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt any of the Martial Laws pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for the government of the Army, he is to ſuffer according to the quality of the offence.</p>
               <p>And thus we have briefly run through the three principals dependant upon the firſt Requirable in the acting of a War, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the Term <hi>Munition.</hi> And ſo we end our firſt Book.</p>

               </p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:191816:44"/>
               <p>And in the firſt place, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome cautions about the election and choice of theſe men; wherein five particulars are moſt conſiderable. 1. That they be rather taken out of barren Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and hard breeding, then out of Cities where there is full feeding and eaſe. 2. That they be young, as rather of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of Age, then eight and forty: for the one may better be brought to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by good Diſcipline, whereas the other are more apt to obſtinacie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, vice. 3. That they be of a middle ſtature, ſtrong of body, and manly looks. 4. That they be of lively ſpirits, reſolute, bold, and well metled. And 5. and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they be of an honeſt condition, and not bred up in effeminate and womaniſh Trades, much leſs in Debauchments and baſeneſs.</p>
               <p>As for the choice of men, in reſpect of the part where they were born; as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natives or Foreiners: I conſent with thoſe who prefer the Natives; in regard they are generally more loyal; in that they are more patient, more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obedient, as being every way more intereſted; in that they are leſs charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:191816:45"/>and ſooner at hand: whereas Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries and Strangers, as well at going as coming, force longer attendance, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expences, and are ſubject to commit many more outrages.</p>
               <p>As touching the election of Souldiers in the point of the kinde of Arms they are to carry: Howſoever the ſtrongeſt and talleſt men are generally ordered to carry Pikes, and the loweſt and nimbleſt to handle the Muſquet; yet it is mine opinion, that above all other things, reſpect and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is to be had, to what Arms every man doth beſt frame himſelf, and to which he ſtands beſt affected. To which end, it is not amiſs, that the Muſter-Maſter take notice of it, before he diſtributeth the Arms to the Individuals.</p>
               <p>And for the Compoſition or number of Souldiers in every private Company (by multiplying of which Companies, Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made; and of Regiments, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:) Howſoever this hath been found much varied, yet in regard of a competent advancement for the Captain, and the performance of his Command, the due and apteſt compoſition ſeemeth to be of two hundred men with Officers and all; to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:191816:45"/>be divided (if you will go according to the vulgar Diſcipline) into two equal Bodies, of one hundred Pikes and one hundred ſhot: or after the late Diſcipline with the <hi>Swedes</hi> (the which in reſpect of the uſe of the fiery weapons, I moſt approve) into twelve Files of Muſqueteers, and nine Files of Pikes; and reckoning ſix men to every File (for ſo many and no more they uſe to order the depth) a compleat Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany may conſiſt of one hundred twenty ſix men, beſides the Officers.</p>
               <p>Now the Officers due to every private Company (to begin at the loweſt, and ſo upwards) are theſe following.</p>
               <p>The Lancepeſado, or Launſpreciado; who is the leading man of the one half of a File, and thence vulgarly termed the Middle-man. And this Officer (as the reſt of them) taketh his place, either by his antiquity, or the reputation of him under whom he commandeth; as the Lancepeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do in the Generals own Company, is the primeſt; as he the meaneſt, that is of the youngeſt Captains Company of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Corporal is the next above this; who is the leader of a whole File, which in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:191816:46"/>number is more or leſs, according to the uſe and cuſtom of ſeveral Diſciplines.</p>
               <p>The next preceding the Corporal, is the Serjeant of the Company; and this Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer hath no ſetled place or leading with the Company, but paſſeth to and again, to ſee that the Files and Ranks be well obſerved in all parts of his Company.</p>
               <p>The Drum is the next Superiour to the Serjeant, who ought to be a Souldier as well as a Drummer, and (if it may be) a Linguiſt, or at the leaſt, a piece of one; that ſo he may take and give all paſſages of Parties about which he is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. And theſe Drums are ranked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Officers and Captains they ſerve under: as, the Drum-Major of the Army is the principal; the Drum-Major of the Regiments next under him, ranked as their Regiments; and then the Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of every Company.</p>
               <p>The next ſuperiour Officer, is the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, or Bearer of the Captains Colours; who is to be a Gentleman, or deſerving to be ſo reputed. And with us (for the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Diſcipline admits of no Lieutenant, but their <hi>Alfereze</hi> or Enſignes ſupplie both places) he taketh place next after the Lieutenant.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:191816:46"/>
               <p>The Lieutenant of a Company is next above the Enſign; and in his Captains ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence acteth all the Captains duties, and in his preſence executeth his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>The Captain is the prime Officer of a private Company, and ought to be as prime in his ſufficiency and abilities. And theſe are the Officers belonging to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Company. For as for the Clerk of the Band, and the Chirurgion, whereof every particular Company ought to have one of each kinde; they are not properly to be accounted Souldiers, nor Military Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as having no Command; though the one as neceſſary for the Captain and Treaſurer in keeping accounts, and the other for the Souldiers, in curing their wounds, as any of the reſt.</p>

               <p>AS for the Officers belonging to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, the loweſt of them is the Quarter-maſter; whoſe Office, beſides the diviſions of the Quarters, is to take up the lodgings for his Regiment, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Harbenger: and he holds rank according to the dignity of the Regiment wherein he ſerves, and of which he hath care.</p>
               <p>The next above the Quarter-maſter, is the Provoſt-Marſhal, who takes the charge of all Delinquents, as alſo of all Priſoners taken of the Enemie; and is to ſee the executions of Juſtice to be duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>In the rank above him is the Serjeant-Major of a Regiment, who is to be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the moſt principal Captains; and his Office is to form and embattel the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:191816:47"/>Regiment, as he ſhall be directed by the Serjeant-Major-General: and he is ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked above all Captains of private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>
               <p>The Officer next ſuperiour to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-Major, is the Lieutenant-Colonel; who in the abſence of the Colonel, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as Colonel; and in his preſence executeth his directions and commands.</p>
               <p>The ſupremeſt Officer of a Regiment is the Colonel; and in dignity is as tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Captains, as they to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. And theſe Colonels are ranked among themſelves, after their antiquity, or the eminencie of their Regiment; the eldeſt Colonel (who of due is alſo to be chief Camp-maſter) holding the firſt and primeſt place.</p>
               <p>Now beſides theſe Officers of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there are certain Officers in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-Royal, which though they have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of charge, and are ſuperiour in that regard to the Officers of a Regiment, yet are not counted, nor attain to be Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Field: and theſe are,</p>
               <p>The Maſter-Gunner of the Army, (who is the meaneſt amongſt them;) and he is an Officer under the Maſter or General
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:191816:48"/>of the Ordnance. And his authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends over all the other Gunners; every one of which he is to overlook in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, and to cauſe them to perform their Duties.</p>
               <p>The next above him is the Trench-Maſter-General; whoſe commands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend over all the Pioneers, and to the laying out their Works: whether they be to be imployed for the Guard or Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Camp, or the raiſing of Sconces, the caſting up of Breſt-works, the laying open of the Ways, or any the like em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
               <p>The Officer next preceding this Trench-Maſter, is the Maſter of the Waggons; and he hath a general command over all the Waggons, Carriages, Sledges, and the like conveyances; and is to order them in their Marches, and to ſee them Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and provided with neceſſary Tools, and the like.</p>
               <p>The Officer ſuperiour next to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Waggons, is the Forrage-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; being a principal Dependant upon the Lord Marſhal; and is to take charge and to diſpoſe of all manner of Proviſions for the Horſe; and to overſee all the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:191816:48"/>Officers of that kinde: and to take care that equal diſtributions be made of thoſe kindes of Proviſions; and to cauſe deſerved executions to be inflicted and impoſed upon the Delinquents of that nature.</p>
               <p>The next to him in place and office, is the Victual-Maſter, or chief Victualler; to whoſe care and charge is delivered all the food and ſuſtenance belonging to the Souldiers: and (by his inferiour Officers, termed the Provant-Maſters) he is to cauſe diſtribution thereof to be made to the Souldiers, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and allowance appointed by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>The Judge-Marſhal is the next ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officer to the chief Victualler; who is to be well skilled in the Civil and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Laws; the which he is to explain, and to make known unto the Souldiers; and to pronounce the cenſures decreed from time to time in the Martial Courts.</p>
               <p>The next Officer preceding the Judge-Martial, is the Scout-maſter-General; who hath the command of all the Scouts; electeth them, and appointeth them their Stations, and giveth them the directions
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:191816:49"/>which he receiveth from the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal. He is alſo a principal Agent in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Camp, and informeth the manner of the Horſe-Parado when the Watch is to be ſet.</p>
               <p>The Officer next above the Scout-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is the Lieutenant of the Ordnance; who hath his chief dependance upon the Maſter of the Ordnance, and ſtands char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in particular with all the ſmaller kindes of the Ordnance, and Munition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto them; and in the abſence of the Maſter, he commands as Maſter.</p>
               <p>The laſt, but chiefeſt of theſe kinde of Officers, is the Muſter-maſter-General; whoſe duty and office is to take the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and muſters of all the Army. He is alſo to have a care that they be well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Arms in good order, and in point; that the particular Companies be kept full. He hath alſo under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and controll all the inferiour Muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters or Commiſſaries, and is to give out all the Warrants for full pay; and checketh all groſs defaults. And this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, though he be none of the Officers of the Field, yet is always to be one of the Council of War.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:191816:49"/>
               <p>The higheſt rank of Officers in a Royal Army, are thoſe ſtiled the Officers of the Field; the loweſt of which kinde is the Serjeant-Major-General, who is ever to be of the Council of War: And he hath the Superviſorſhip of all the Serjeant-Majors of the Army. This Officer in the Swediſh Diſcipline, is termed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-General.</p>
               <p>The Colonel-General is the next ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to him; upon whom reſteth the hearing, and compoſing, and ordering of all differences of any high nature. And he alſo is evermore to be one of the Council of War.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant-General of the Horſe, is next in order of precedencie; who hath the ſame Command amongſt the Horſe, that the Colonel-General hath with the Foot; and by his place is always one of the Council of War.</p>
               <p>The chief Treaſurer of the Army hath the next precedency; and he is under no command ſave onely the Generals. He is to fix his reſpect thorowout the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and in peculiar, is to have an Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Auditor, Muſter-maſter, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary of the Army, in relation to their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:191816:50"/>accounts. He alſo is by his place to be one of the Council of War.</p>
               <p>The Maſter of the Ordnance is the next above him, and is a principal Officer of the Field; as having under his command all the Artillery, Munition, and the whole Train belonging unto them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly one of the Council of War.</p>
               <p>The Lord Marſhal hath the next place of precedencie; and his commands ſtretch every way both over Horſe and Foot. He hath alſo the prerogative to make good whatſoever ſhall be found fit in point of Matial Law. And I have known him in the abſence of the Generaliſſimo, to have the command in chief: But this was when there was no Lieutenant-General. He is always a Counſeller of War.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant-General is as it were the younger brother to the General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: for in his abſence he hath his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign authority, and the abſolute command of the whole Army; and at all times is as it were the Superintendent over all of them.</p>
               <p>The General is he that ruleth all; ſo that it is to be expected that he ſhould be every way alſo as ſupereminent: And the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:191816:50"/>rather, in regard that in an Army there is to be but onely one Generaliſſimo. For though it hath ſometime been ſeen that two men have been put in this Command with equal Commiſſion, yet do I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ever any Army ſo comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded returned with Victory.</p>

The Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of every Corporalſhip is to be the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the chief File thereof; and the Lancepriſado (who in the Corporals ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when he is upon the Guard or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, executes the Corporals duties) is to lead another File; and the practick and ready men of every Corporalſhip are to lead the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Company being thus divided and ordered, theſe things are mainly to be taught: the carriage and uſe of Arms, Marches and Motions; and the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſounds of the Drum, and words of Command and Direction; which are rightly termed the Souldiers <hi>Vocabula Artis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The carriage of Arms is to be appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the moſt of comelineſs and uſe. The uſe of the Pike, is either in receiving or giving a charge. By being taught the firſt, the Souldier learns to withſtand the Horſe; by the ſecond, to encounter with the Enemies Pikes, and to underſtand when and how every man, and ſo every rank are to give their puſh or blow. In
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:191816:51"/>the uſe of the Muſquet, the Souldier is firſt to learn how to preſent his Piece, how to take his level, and when to give his Volley with thoſe of his Rank.</p>
               <p>Now the ancient and vulgar manner of Diſcipline for the giving of Volleys of ſhot, was, that all the ſhot of one Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralſhip ſhould give fire at once. But this was abſolutely condemnable: for either thoſe in the Rear muſt hazard the ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their leaders through their heads; or elſe over-ſhoot the Enemy, and ſpend their Powder in vain. And beſides, the Volley thus delivered being once given, the Enemy may come on without impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or annoyance. In ſtead of this therefore, a more uſeful practice hath been, to order the firſt Rank onely to give their Volley; and if the body of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany march, then that Rank that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Volley to ſtand; and the ſecond Rank to paſs thorough it, and to give their Volley, and then they to ſtand; and then the third Rank to advance and give fire: and ſo all the reſt of the Ranks in order. But if the Company, or Brigade, or Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taglia ſtand firm, then the firſt Rank ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given their Volleys, are to fall back,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:191816:52"/>and the ſecond to come in their rooms; and ſo the third, fourth, and the reſt. And by this courſe (the men being commanded men) the Vollies may be continued, and the Enemy never free from annoyance. And all this is eaſily performed, if at the firſt all the ſhot be cauſed to open their Files to open diſtance.</p>
               <p>But becauſe even this alſo is defective, in reſpect that there cannot be brought up ſo many hands to give fire at once upon the Enemie, as were to be wiſht; that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Souldier the late King of <hi>Swedeland</hi> diſciplin'd his ſhot to give fire three ranks at once: and this was done by cauſing the firſt rank to give their Volleys upon their knees; the ſecond ſomewhat ſtooping, over their leaders heads; the third rank ſtanding upright, to give their Volleys over all their heads: and this to be done at one and the ſame time. And by this means and courſe was poured more Lead upon the Enemie at once, then otherwiſe by far, by any of the other ways.</p>
               <p>And this manner of giving fire muſt needs alſo be very uſeful and advantagious in all Wood-Services, and whereſoever an Enemie is to be encountred in narrow
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:191816:52"/>Lanes or Paths, where men cannot be led up but in a ſingle file: for if the three firſt men thus giving fire, be inſtructed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have given their Volley to place themſelves cloſe up by the ſides of the path where the Enemie preſents himſelf, and ſo ſtand there ſidelong towards the Enemie, and give place for three others of their followers to advance and do the like; a continued Volley of Shot may be thus delivered, although the whole file of men ſhould conſiſt but of fifteen in all.</p>
               <p>As for the Diſcipline belonging to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; after every man once knoweth his proper place, and underſtandeth how to obſerve his file and rank, there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty at all in a plain march. In a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march alſo, if the leaders of the files be well choſen, and that every man obſerve his leading man, there is no great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty neither. As touching motions, ſome are performed without change of place, by turning onely their faces to the right hand, or to the left, or about, as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is found to charge either in Flank or Rear: Some require a change of place, and theſe motions are performed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from one rank to another; and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:191816:53"/>then ſome move, and ſome ſtand ſtill. And theſe kindes of motions are called dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings of ranks, and doublings of files, as the Enemie or Ground ſhall give cauſe, to make the Front or Flank greater or leſſer. There is beſides theſe another kinde of motion to be taught, in which all do move, and yet none do march: And this is done by the opening and cloſing of files; and is practiſed not onely when one rank is to paſs thorow another, or the whole Brigade to make a Counter-march; but alſo when there is an intention to draw the Troop together in haſte, and yet in order more to the one hand then the other. And thus far only ſhall be ſpoken in this place touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Motions; intending to ſpeak more at large of the uſe of them hereafter.</p>
               <p>Concerning the underſtanding of the ſound of the Drum; the Souldiers are to be taught not only to know and obſerve what the Drummer beats, but what time he keeps in beating; that accordingly they may haſten or ſlack their marchings: As by the voice they are called upon to all other motions, of which likewiſe we ſhall ſay more, as occaſion ſhall require.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE have gone thus far towards the proportioning of the body of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as to bring the Men or Bodies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to fit them with Chiefs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and to give them ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the uſe of their Arms: We have likewiſe ſpoken in the beginning of our firſt Book, of ſuch kindes of Arms as are fitted for the perſons of men, and are por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in their hands. It remains that we give ſome advertiſements touching thoſe ſorts of Arms or Weapons which are to be carried with Armies, but are not porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the men. And theſe are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the name of Artillery, or great Guns; of which though we have ſpoken ſomewhat in the former part of our Treatiſe, yet it was onely of ſuch as were to be lodged in Forts and Towns of War, and to be employed againſt them;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:191816:54"/>and not of thoſe to be uſed in the Field, and to accompany and march with an Army.</p>
               <p>We ſhall therefore in this Chapter and the next, take notice of the great Guns requirable for an Army-Royal; together with their kindes, carriages, caſting, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and choice. And we will propound this Army to conſiſt of forty thouſand men; of which, thirty four thouſand to be Foot, and ſixt houſand Horſe: which is a repartition that may hold proportion with all other numbers, if reduced an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably.</p>
               <p>As for the number therefore of great Guns requirable for ſuch an Army in its march: It hath been regulated (after much debate) by ſome experimented Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that for every thouſand of Souldiers there ſhould be allowed one piece of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnance; and ſo for forty thouſand men (as here propounded) forty great Guns. But for mine own part, I finde not how this can be brought to any certaintie: for who knows not but that ſeveral occaſions, different ways, and particular accidents may, and muſt alter the proportion? ſo that herein no other Law or Rule can be preciſely preſcribed, then what opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:191816:54"/>offers, and neceſſity urgeth. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, if I ſhould be put to it, to ſet down a ſtrict and preciſe number of great Guns for an Army of forty thouſand men, I would ſooner propound thirtie pieces then fortie. And my reaſons are: Firſt, in that thirty great Guns diſponed and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, at the Angles of the Armies Front, ſhall ſufficiently ſerve upon all approaches of an Enemie, either whileſt the Army marcheth, or when it is to be ordered to a fight. Secondly, in that theſe thirty pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall be ſufficient alſo, (duly choſen) for the beſieging and battering of any place, though there ſhould be a conſtraint of raiſing two Batteries, having each of them three Camerades in ſix mounts. And laſtly, in that by thus leſſening the number of the great Guns, as much as may be, there may withal be a leſſening of the number and Train due unto them, with the expence for the furniture, and the charge of the Draught-horſes, and their Forrage: together with the like reſt of the unavoidable preſſures.</p>
               <p>Touching the kindes of ſuch great Guns as are moſt proper to anſwer all the occaſions of an Army-Royal: they are
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:191816:55"/>(in my opinion) to be Cannons of Battery, Demy-canons, thoſe called (by the French) Quart du Cannons, Culverins, and Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces: thus to be repartited; Of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons nine, of the Demy-cannons eight, of the Culverins (or Quart du Cannons) ſix, and of the Field-pieces ſeven. The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to be employed for battery onely at Aſſieges; and the reſt, as well for the ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the <hi>Campagnia</hi> on all ſides, as to play upon all the Avenues of the Enemy when they come near. And beſides, being thus ordered into theſe kindes, they cannot be ſo over-topped in the largeneſs of their bores, but that the Enemies bullets ſent upon them, may from ſome of theſe pieces be returned upon thoſe that ſent them; and hereby that ſcarcity and default of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets ſupplied, which by many occaſions and accidents may befal the beſt provided Army that is.</p>
               <p>And an example of the neglect hereof, and the ill that ſucceeded upon it, we have in the Wars between <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth and the French King; where the Emperour getting Intelligence that the Artillery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the French Army were all of them of the ſmaller kindes, gave order to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:191816:55"/>the Maſter of his Ordnance to furniſh his own Army with ſuch Guns, whoſe cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or bores were greater then thoſe of the Enemies; whereby it came to paſs, that in a long play of the Ordnance of both ſides one upon another, the French fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a want of bullets, whereas the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts had abundance; theſe being able to retort and make uſe of the Enemies bullets, but not thoſe of theirs: whereby the Imperialiſts at that time obtained a remarkable Victory.</p>
               <p>As for the number of Horſe requirable for the draught of theſe ſeveral kindes of great Guns formerly mentioned: For every Cannon there are to be allowed three and twenty Horſe in fair and level ways; and in foul and uneven, thirty. And this is alſo when the Cannon is to be drawn in a Waggon or Cart: for if it be to be carried in its proper Carriage, there are never leſs to be allowed then thirty Horſe in the eveneſt and faireſt ways. For a Demy-cannon are to be provided fifteen Horſe at the feweſt; and ſeventeen in foul and hilly ways. For the Culverin and the Field-piece, nine Horſe in fair ways, and ten in foul. But withal, give me leave
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:191816:56"/>to give this caution, that for the Cannon, Demy-cannon, and thoſe heavy Guns, it is far more commodious and ſafe always to employ the long kinde of Waggons with lofty Wheels, then to have thoſe Pieces drawn mounted in their proper Carriages. And the reaſons are: That there ſhall not need to be ſo many horſes for the draught of a great Gun in a Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, as when it is in its Carriage: That the Waggon, by reaſon of the heighth of its Wheels, and its lightneſs, is fitter and better able to paſs thorow all foul, ſandy, mooriſh and moiſt ways, then the Carriage can poſſibly be: That theſe kind of long Waggons are not onely commodious for the portage of the great Guns, but (if need require) for the conveyance alſo of many pieces of Timber for the building of brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the carriage of them, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like occaſions. And beſides, if an Enemy ſhould attempt an aſſault, or to give on upon any encampment; theſe Waggons may moſt aptly and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be uſed for the Barricadoing of all Avenues, and ſurrounding of all the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Camp; and that on a ſudden, in the nature of a ſlight Trench: ſo that the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:191816:56"/>Enemie, and eſpecially the Enemies Horſe, ſhall not be able to charge home, but with great diſadvantage and loſs.</p>
               <p>And if againſt this portage of theſe Guns in VVaggons, it ſhall be objected, that they cannot be ſo readily employed upon ſudden Alarms and Onſets of the Enemie, as when they are drawn in their own proper Carriages; it may be replied, that all ſuch ſudden alarms may as well be anſwered by the leſſer ſorts of Guns, which at all times may march in their own Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, as by the Cannons and higher pieces: for theſe perform the work as well afar off as the Cannon doth. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, whenſoever the march of an Army is duly marſhalled, and the Avant-cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers providently ordered, an Army can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo aſſaulted on a ſudden, but that intelligence may be gotten, and a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of time found to mount and order theſe great Pieces upon their proper Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, out of the VVaggons, by Gins and the like Engines, which are conſtantly to accompany them; and ſo be brought time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough to the angles of the great divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and with all freedom perform all executions upon the aſſailing Enemy. And
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:191816:57"/>whileſt this is in agitation, the lighter and leſſer pieces carried mounted upon their proper Carriages, may play at random, and ſo retard, amuſe, and annoy the aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemie, and gain time. And thus much concerning the kindes, number, and portage of great Guns fitted and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated for a Royal Army conſiſting of fortie thouſand men. We ſhall in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Chapter preſcribe ſome rules how to caſt great Guns, and to finde where they are faulty, that they may be refuſed: how to avoid the accidental cauſes of their ſhooting awry; how to know when they are ſufficiently fortified; how they are to be cooled and cleared; what quantity of powder belongs to the due lading of every Piece; and what the weight of their ſhot is: with ſome other particulars of that nature.</p>

               <p>SUch great Guns therefore as are caſt Taper-bored, that is, not carrying an equal bore, or having the metal thicker on the one ſide then on the other, are to be refuſed: for with ſuch, no Gunner can make a ſtraight or certain ſhot; neither can ſuch pieces be any ways rectified but by a new caſting. And if a neceſſity force the uſe of any ſuch, care is to be taken that the choice of the ſhot be made under the ſize of the bore, leſt it ſtick upon the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:191816:58"/>crooked ſide or part, and endanger the breaking of the Piece. And in making of the ſhot, or ranging of the level, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is to be had to the ſide of the Piece that the crookedneſs enclineth unto. In ſuch Pieces likewiſe whoſe bores, though they be ſtraight, are yet more inclinable to one ſide of the metal then the other, great heed is to be taken that they be not laden to the full of their powder; for ſo they will undoubtedly break: nor is it poſſible to make a right ſhot in any ſuch Gun, by reaſon that the aim or level can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken from the midſt of the bore, unleſs a due allowance be given to that part and ſide towards which the bore and concavity is moſt placed, and ſo to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and aimed thereafter. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that many pieces of Ordnance, and eſpecially ſuch as have been much uſed, become ſometimes more enlarged at the muzzle or mouth then in any other part of the bore; it is therefore a neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that for a ſudden ſervice, the ſhot to be uſed in theſe Guns, or ſuch-like Guns, be not choſen to the full heighth of the bore at the mouth of the Piece, but rather a ſize under; leſt in a haſty lading, the ſhot
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:191816:58"/>ſtick by the way, before it fall up cloſe with the powder: in which caſe it cannot be ſtirred but with art and time, nor the Gun to be uſed without extream danger in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Such great Guns alſo as are unequally and improperly poiſed, are to be held faulty; and ſuch whoſe Trunnions are not duly placed: for hereby they either become too weighty at their breeches, and ſo upon every diſcharge ſtart up with their muzzles; or elſe over-heavy before, and then under-ſink as much that way: ſo that no Gunner whatſoever, be he never ſo true an Arts-man, can make a ſure ſhot with any ſuch. For it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the ſhot will hereby be carried either over-high or over-low towards the mark that is aimed at.</p>
               <p>Thoſe great Guns likewiſe that are caſt with pores, cracks, or ſmall holes, (which are termed Honey-combs) within their concavities, are by all means to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for unleſs upon every diſcharge they be thorowly waſhed and ſponged with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or vineger, whenſoever occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a ſudden recharging of them, the Gunners that lade them become in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:191816:59"/>peril, by reaſon that ſome ſparks of fire may and are likely to lie hid within theſe holes, and thereby the Ladle full of Powder fired, as the Gunner is conveying it home into the chamber of the Piece. Now the ways to finde out and diſcover theſe Honey-combs, may be (if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be fair, and the Sun ſhine bright) by traverſing the mouth of the Piece directly againſt the beams of the Sun, and then holding a Looking-Glaſs in ſuch a manner between the Sun and the mouth of the Gun, that it may carry the reverberation of the Suns beams into the hollow of the Piece, that by the light thereof theſe pores and holes may thus be viſibly diſcerned. A ſecond way there is to this purpoſe, by taking a Wax-candle, and faſtning it to the end of a ſtrait ſtaff, and lighting the candle, ſo to put it into the bore or cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Gun. And by any of theſe means, theſe Honey-combs may be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly diſcovered, whereſoever they are, by the eye.</p>
               <p>As for the accidental cauſes of ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awry out of great Guns, they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; of which the Gunner is to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: As, when the Trunnions of a Piece
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:191816:59"/>are not placed directly one againſt another: when the plat-form lieth unequal, with the one ſide more elevated then the other: when one of the wheels of the Carriage is any thing higher then the other; for then the ſhot will incline to the lower wheel: when one wheel is more ſtreight upon the axle-tree, or more greaſed then the other: when one wheel ſtands upon ſofter ground then the other: when the opening of the Carriage is more on the one ſide then on the other: when the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is over-large, ſo that the piece lieth not firm. Conſideration is alſo to be had of the Wind, and an allowance to be made of the weathering of the mark. Care is likewiſe to be taken, leſt ſome ſtone or the like impediment lie in the way of the wheels reverſe. In all which particulars, a conſiderate Gunner is to be very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: for any one of them being neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will aſſuredly deceive in the point of ſhooting right. And by this alſo it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and muſt be confeſſed; that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the certainty in ſhooting right and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect out of great Ordnance, though it be much to be affected, it is nevertheleſs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hazardouſly attained.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:191816:60"/>
               <p>It is likewiſe to be obſerved, that in making of any ſhot out of any great Piece, and eſpecially when it is intended upon Squadrons, or main Bodies, either of Horſe or Foot, ſtanding fixt, it is more behoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to under-ſhoot the mark, then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoot it: for ſo, if the place afford any ſtones or the like rubbiſh, the fall and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bullet upon theſe, will effect far more to the Enemies damage, then the ſhot it ſelf can, though it hit the very mark that is aimed at; whereas the over-ſhot executes not at all any way. And in the making of a ſhot at a moving mark, be it at a Boat, or Ship under ſail, or a body of Men or Horſe in a ſwift march, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is to be taken whether the motion be towards you, direct upon you, or in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by you; and the Gunner is to lay his Piece accordingly, and to give fire, that the ſhot may fall juſt in the way.</p>
               <p>An eſpecial care is alſo to be taken in the caſting of great Guns (by ſuch as are either to over-look them, or to make choice of them) touching the point of their being ſufficiently fortified. Of which I will give inſtance in the Cannon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and the Cannon ordinary; and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:191816:60"/>in the extraordinary Culverin, and the ordinary Culverin.</p>
               <p>The extraordinary Cannon in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference at the chamber, is to be of 8 calibers, at the Trunnions 6, and at the neck 5⅔. The ordinary Cannon is to be in the circumference of the chamber 7⅘, at the Trunnions 6⅗, at the neck 5 8/9. The Culverin extraordinarily fortified, is to have in circumference <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>. As for the leſſer pieces, they may all of them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by theſe proportions, according to their ſeveral kindes and quantities. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is to be obſerved, that the leſſer the Pieces be, they are always to be ſo much the longer, and the better fortified in their metals; and this as well to provide againſt an over-violent reverſe, as to preſerve them from lying over-ſhort in their Ports; and alſo that by their extraordinary forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, they may the better endure often diſcharges.</p>
               <p>As for their Ports, we ſhall onely add here, that they are to be in their ſizes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:191816:61"/>to the greatneſs and ſize of the Guns that are to be placed in them. And thus for a Cannon, the innermoſt part of the Port is to be three foot in the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the outermoſt, twelve. For a Demy-cannon, the innermoſt part to be 2 ½ of feet, and the outermoſt nine; and ſo of the reſt proportionably. And to give a competencie of place upon the Platform where theſe Guns are to lie, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently managed, charged, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there ought not to be leſs diſtance then twenty foot between Port and Port; ſo that the wheel of the Carriage of one Piece, of one Gun, may be fifteen foot in diſtance from the wheel of the other. And theſe Ports are on their inſides to be raiſed from the floor of the Platform as much in heighth, as they are in largeneſs; and on their inſides to be as much ſlented down, that ſo the Pieces may be traverſed to play downwards upon all the Avenues of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>As touching the number of diſcharges that great Guns may endure, ſuddenly one after another: It is held that in ſuch of them as are extraordinarily fortified, and re-inforced, (as aforeſaid) ten ſhot
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:191816:61"/>may be allowed for a convenient number to be made out of one Piece, in one hours ſpace; and eight out of thoſe that are leſs fortified. But with this caveat, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forty ſhot given even in this manner, the Guns are to be refreſhed; for there is nothing that more cauſeth the decay of great Ordnance, then the often heating of them: in which regard, it is very good providence that they be refreſhed often, and eſpecially in hot weather, or a hot Country.</p>
               <p>Now the ways to refreſh them, are by the uſe of fair water mixed with vineger; and upon urging occaſion, to wet Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins or the like herein, and ſo to lay them on the outſide of the metal of the Gun, and there to let them lie until the heat of the Piece be ſenſibly found to be allayed. The uſe of Lie alſo is very commendable in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Gunners are likewiſe to take notice, that ſuch great Guns as have layen long charged with their ſhot in them, are not to be given fire unto on the ſudden as they lie, becauſe the ſhot may in all likelyhood be ruſted within them, and ſo in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge may hazard the breaking of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:191816:62"/>Piece. They are therefore firſt of all to draw out the wad lying before the ſhot, and then to looſen the ſhot with the Ladle, and if it may be, to get it out. But if the ſhot be ſo ruſted as not to be ſtirred by the Ladle, the courſe then is to abaſe the muzzle of the Piece, and to pour into the touch-hole ſo much water as may drain away the force and beſt part of the ſtrength of the Powder, and then to put into the concavity of the Piece by the touch-hole, ſo much freſh powder as may onely ſerve to blow out the ſhot: the which may thus be done, with all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Having thus delivered ſome cautions touching all theſe particulars, we will conclude this Chapter with giving ſome advertiſements touching the due quantity of the powder, and the weight of the ſhot belonging to all theſe kindes of great Guns formerly mentioned: together with their ſeveral lengths, and the lengths of their Carriages; as alſo of their ſeveral ranges at point-blank, and at their higheſt elevation: mentioning withal, ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary obſervations touching their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts and their Platforms, and the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:191816:62"/>neceſſaries due unto them all.</p>
               <p>And we will begin with the whole Culverin, which ſhoots a bullet of twenty pounds in weight; and the Powder as well groſs as refined, after the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of four or three fifths: the length of the Piece being of thirty two Calibers, which make ſixteen Geometrical feet; the level range ſix hundred ſteps; the fartheſt range ſeven thouſand one hundred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſteps.</p>
               <p>The Demy-Culverin carries a bullet of ten pounds in weight, with ⅘ weight of fine powder, that is, eight pounds: the length thereof thirty three calibers, which make thirteen feet; the level range four hundred and fifty ſteps; the higheſt range five thouſand three hundred ſeventy three ſteps.</p>
               <p>The Saker ſhoots a ſhot of five pounds in weight, and as much of fine powder: it carries a length of thirty five calibers; the range point-blank three hundred and fifty ſteps; by elevation, four thouſand one hundred thirty nine ſteps.</p>
               <p>The Falcon carries a ſhot of two pounds and an half, with the like weight of powder corned: the length thirty ſix
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:191816:63"/>calibers; the level range, two hundred ſeventy nine paces or ſteps; by elevation, three thouſand three hundred eighteen.</p>
               <p>The double Cannon ſhoots a ball of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix pounds in weight, of corned powder fortie pounds. It is to be in length ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen calibers; the level range, ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces; at the higheſt elevation, ſeven thouſand one hundred and forty paces.</p>
               <p>The ſingle Cannon carries a ſhot of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds, the powder twenty pounds; the length, eighteen calibers; the level range, five hundred ſteps; at elevation, five thouſand nine hundred ſixty eight ſteps.</p>
               <p>The Demy-Cannon ſhoots a ſhot of twenty four pounds, with twelve pounds of powder; the length, twenty calibers; the level range, four hundred twenty five paces; at elevation, five thouſand ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſteps.</p>
               <p>The double Culverin, being of Braſs, its charge of powder amounteth to fortie pounds, when ſerpentine; of corned powder thirtie five pounds; the weight of the ſhot, fortie pounds: the length of the Piece, one and thirty calibers; the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:191816:63"/>range, one thouſand three hundred ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four ſteps; at elevation, eight thouſand one hundred ſixty ſeven ſteps. And theſe kindes of Braſs double Culverins, I believe carry the fartheſt of any others: for the fartheſt range of the moſt renowned Pieces that ever I heard or read of, hath not been obſerved to have been much above three Engliſh miles; and therefore theſe ſteps formerly mentioned, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of ſingle ſtrides onely, and not paces, which are as much again.</p>
               <p>Touching the diſpart of great Guns; he cannot be any true pretender to Gunner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that knows it not; it being the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity betwixt the circumference of the Piece at the breech or chamber, and that of the muzzle. Hence is it that in the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Piece upon the level range, a conſideration is to be had, that the muzzle of the Piece be ſo much abaſed, as may anſwer to the over-thickneſs it hath at the breech, beyond that of the mouth; that ſo the concavity or cylinder of the Piece may be brought to ſhoot in a level line right forwards.</p>
               <p>Now this diſpart may be taken divers ways; of which one of the moſt readie
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:191816:64"/>is, by putting a ſmall twig or piece of wyer into the touch-hole of the Piece before it be laden, and ſo to take the preciſe depth from the ſuperficies of the metal to the bottom of the Bore or concavity of the Piece; and then ſetting that meaſure at the mouth of the Piece upon the lower ſide of the cylinder, ſo much of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as appears above the metal of the muzzle, is to be received for the diſpart of the Piece; and ſo the Gun being to ſhoot right forwards in a ſtrait line, to be ſo much abaſed as may bring the very top of the meaſure with a direct level upon the mark that is aimed at.</p>
               <p>But becauſe even this way of taking diſparts (and indeed much more all other ways) will take up more time then can be allowed in a ſudden and hot ſervice; it is the part of a true Gunner to carry the ſeveral diſparts of all kindes of Guns ſo well fixed in his mind and conſideration, that without any more adoe, he may be able to allow every kind of Piece the due diſpart; that is to ſay, a ſufficient under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay at the muzzle, to anſwer the thickneſs of the chamber. And this to be done only by diſcretion and judgment.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:191816:64"/>
               <p>As for the laying of the Platforms whereon great Guns are to be mounted upon their Carriages, in reſpect they are very eſſential to the point of their quick uſe and employment, as well as to their ſhooting right; ſome Gunners have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed that the hinder part of a Platform ſhould be raiſed far higher then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, to facilitate the traverſe of the Gun into the Port after its diſcharge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. But for my part, I ſhall not wiſh it to be elevated above one foot at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt; for hereby the balls will be cauſed to fall ſhort, by reaſon that the mouth of the Guns muſt needs be ſwayed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in their reverſes, and the Piece it ſelf ſo thrown upon the Port with its own weight, that for the recharge, much both of time and labour will be required to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it. And beſides, if the Enemy have any great Guns in a counter-beating upon the Ports at the ſame time, they muſt needs execute dangerouſly upon all ſuch as are to attend and manage theſe Pieces, and are to ſtay any length of time at or about the Ports. And therefore (as I ſaid before) a moderate elevation of the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of a Platform may be commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:191816:65"/>but by no means to be over-high nor lofty.</p>
               <p>Touching the proportions of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries requirable for great Guns (with which we will end this Chapter) they are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. To every Piece of Ordnance, of what kind ſoever, belong the Charger or Ladle, the Sponge, the Coins, the Bed; and theſe beſides the body of the Carriage. As concerning the Carriage it ſelf, an eſpecial heed is to be had that the Axle-tree be ſound and ſtrong; that the wheels be perfect and fit, with a convenient quantity of Greaſe or Tallow due unto them, to facilitate their reverſes.</p>
               <p>And for the uſe of the Guns, in point of ſhot and powder, the proportion of one hundred great ſhot for every Piece may be held convenient, with an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity of powder; the which is to be proportioned after the ſizes of the Pieces, as was formerly noted.</p>
               <p>And thus we have run thorow all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars belonging unto the Train of the Artillery requirable for an Army conſiſting of forty thouſand men. It remains only, that we advertiſe ſomewhat touching the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and other attendants due unto this Train.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>The Officers belonging to the Artillery: their peculiar duties. Some advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Gunners.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe peculiar Officers of a Royal Train of Artillery, are theſe; the General or the Maſter, his two Lieutenants, the Treaſurer, the Pay-maſter, the Maſter of the Munition, and a Muſter-Maſter. And theſe being the prime Officers, are to be nominated either by the Prince himſelf, or the General of the Army.</p>
               <p>The inferiour Officers to theſe, are the Gentlemen of the Artillery, the which in an Army of fortie thouſand men, with the Train of Artillery anſwerable to it, ought not to be fewer then fifteen: and this proportion may be held according to the number of any Army. The Conductors are to be twelve, the Conſtables four, the Gunners fourſcore, the Porters two, the Farriers two, the Smiths two, the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in ordinary four; to which, as aids, are to be added the Carpenters extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, with their chief, in number thirtie;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:191816:66"/>the Miners, with their Commander, fiftie; the Engineers for fire-works, two; the Engineers for Fortification, two; the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarders, ſix; the Provoſt, one, with his Lieutenant and Halberdeers; Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, one; Phyſician, one; Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, two; Apothecary, one; Pioneers to lay ſmooth the ways and make them paſſable, at leaſt one thouſand. And if there be any paſſages by water to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, it will be neceſſary to have one hundred Sea-men, or at the leaſt, men uſed in ſome reaſonable manner to thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. And for the comfort of all their ſouls, there is to be a Miniſter of Gods Word, to take the charge of them in that nature.</p>
               <p>Concerning the peculiar duties of theſe forementioned Officers, thoſe of the prime ſort are ſufficiently known, and are to be of ability to overſee all the reſt, and as well to direct them, as to take and give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them; and ſome of them have been forementioned. As for the reſt, the charge belonging to the Gentlemen of the Artillery, is to take the care of all the Train, and eſpecially of the Guns them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a march; to be always in guard
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:191816:66"/>thereof in the Quarters: and in point of Battel and Service, they are each one of them to take two or three Pieces into his particular care: they are to ſollicite the Gunners to plie their Ordnance, and to beſtow them well and profitably. In the planting of the Batteries they are to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the General; and being well armed, to advance in all places of danger, and not to ſuffer him to be over-engaged in his own perſon. They are to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thorowly, as well of all the Defences of the Enemy, as of the means of diſabling them. And laſtly, they are to overlook the Pioneers, and ſuch as labour at the Batteries, and to cauſe them to act their parts diligently and uſefully upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>The peculiar duties of the Conductors of the Artillery, are to take the charge of the Waggons and Carriages belonging to the whole Train, and to cauſe them to be ordered according to inſtructions from the General. They are alſo to ſee all the powder and ſhot to be ſafely lodged and guarded. They are all of them, every one in his allotted place, to be preſent at the Batteries, and there to execute duly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:191816:67"/>and diligently whatſoever the General ſhall appoint.</p>
               <p>The parts and duties of the Conſtables of the Artillery, are to lay out and deſcribe all the Ports of the Batteries; to viſit all the great Guns when they are in their Quarters, and to ſee them in point; to ſee them conducted to the Batteries, and delivered up to the Gunners, with all the appurrenances belonging to them; as Coins, Levers, Ladles, Sponges, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Shot, Powder, Wads, Tackling, and the like. They are likewiſe to take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, and to advertiſe all the due Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Pieces, and to make them known to the Lieutenant and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Ordnance. They are to Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and fit all the ſhot to the bore of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Gun, and to ſee them laid on heaps by every Piece. They are alſo to have a care that the Gunners be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted with Linſtocks, armed with their ſhort ſwords, provided with their Powder-horns and priming irons of all ſizes, and with their Compaſſes, Quadrants, and the like neceſſaries. They are alſo upon the caſting of any new Piece to viſit them carefully, and to cauſe them to be every
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:191816:67"/>way ordered according to commands and directions from the General.</p>
               <p>As for the Office and duty of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it being generally known what they are to do, and ſome printed Pamphlets teaching how to do it, I ſhall not enlarge my ſelf farther that way, then onely to give ſome few Caveats: And ſhall in the firſt place adviſe, that before any admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be made of any ſuch, the pretenders be thorowly and impartially examined and put to the Teſt by the Maſter of the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, or ſome able and honeſt men, ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to that end. And for the eaſe of theſe Subſtitutes, I ſhall preſume to put them in mind to obſerve unto their Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners theſe few particulars following, which perhaps are not ſo carefully heeded as it were fit and behoveful in theſe caſes. As,</p>
               <p>That in the lading of their Guns (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if time and leiſure may allow) after the ſecond Ladle-ful of powder is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the chamber of the Piece, and there well ſettled by the Rammer, care be taken that the concavity of the Piece be thorowly cleanſed by a drie Sponge, or convenient Wad; leſt by the remainder of ſome grains of looſe powder in the way,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:191816:68"/>there accrue ſome peril by the rowling down of the ſhot, which may fire by the way, and fire the reſt of the powder in the chamber, to the ſpoil of the Gunner: That in the letting fall of the ſhot into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity of the Gun, when it is charged with powder, an eſpecial care be had that the ſhot be firſt well cleanſed; and that no piece of any ſandy or ſtony ſubſtance be fixed unto it; the which may procure danger, both by lodging of the ſhot by the way before it get home to the powder, and by hindering the free iſſue of it upon the diſcharge: That the Gunner in the lading of his Piece, ſtand not before the mouth of it with any part of his body, leſt he be ſpoiled by ſome accidental firing of it, cauſed by ſome ſecret hony-combs, or the like.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the peculiar duties of the prime Officers belonging to a Train of Artillery. As for the reſt of them, their very names ſpeak the nature of their duties, and therefore deſerve no farther deſcription.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE are now come to the conduction of an Army in a march, wherein, in the firſt place, it is requiſite that the Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor be well informed of the nature of the Country through which he is to carry the Army: as, whether it be Champion or Mountanous, whether ſubject to Mariſhes or not. And eſpecially he ought to be careful to be well provided with siklful and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:191816:69"/>truſty Guides. And upon the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature and condition of the Country, he is to determine the order of the march.</p>
               <p>As for example: an Army made up of forty thouſand men (which number was formerly propounded) being to march in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion Country in order of battel, and the Enemie near, may be thus marſhalled: Firſt of all, in the point before the Foot may march five hundred Horſe, being Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlets or Cuiraſſiers, repartited into more or fewer diviſions, as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: And theſe are in the nature of a Forlorn-hope, to make diſcoveries upon all the paſſages on all ſides, and to clear the Woodie places of all ambuſhments. Next after theſe, may march two thouſand Foot, divided into more or fewer bodies, anſwerable to the Horſe in the point: And they are as well to ſerve for a Second or Reſerve to theſe Horſe, as to defend that part of the Artillery marching in the Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. After theſe two thouſand Foot, the diviſion of the Artillery for the Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the Army is to be ordered, with the requiſite Waggons of great ſhot, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, coins, and the like neceſſaries; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:191816:69"/>with a ſufficient number of Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, to prepare and lay open the ways and paſſages, and to make needful defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And in this diviſion there are to be of great Guns, four Field-pieces at the leaſt, mounted on their proper Carriages, and attended with one Waggon of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and another of ſhot, with all things anſwerable, commanded by an experienced Lieutenant, with ſome of the Gentlemen of the Ordnance and their Gunners.</p>
               <p>After this diviſion may march four Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verins, with a Waggon of powder and another of ſhot, with the appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>After theſe, four Demy-Cannons by pairs, with their Gins, Powder, Shot, and other neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>And in the Rear of all theſe may march four whole Cannons, with all that belongs unto them: as, four Waggons of Powder, eight Waggons of Shor, with all things anſwerable. And theſe are the reparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Artillery, which are to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to march in the Van of an Army of forty thouſand men.</p>
               <p>After this body, and diviſion of theſe Ordnance, three thouſand Light-horſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:191816:70"/>or Dragoons are to be ordered to march; and after them, ten thouſand Foot. And in the Rear of theſe, all the Munitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the one half of the Army; as, Bridges, Planks, Powder, Shot, Cordage, Palliſadoes, Pikes, Shovels, Crabs, Coins as well of Wood as Iron; together with all the Tools belonging to the Carpenters, Smiths, and the like Artificers. All which are to be handſomely lodged in Waggons.</p>
               <p>The Victuallers or Sucklers of the moyety of the Army, are to be ordered to march in the next place, with the Hoſpital, followed with the Carriages and Waggons belonging to the General, and the other Commanders in chief; and after them, that part of the Baggage belonging partly to the Vant-guard, and partly to the Battel.</p>
               <p>After theſe, may march twelve thouſand Foot, ordered into ſmall Bodies, having in the Rear of them a Body of Waggons of Baggage, whereof part is to belong to the middle-Guard, or Battel, and part to the Rear-Guard; followed with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals Life-Guards, and the ſuit of the Ambaſſadours.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:191816:70"/>
               <p>Next again after theſe may follow the Munitions and Engines ſerving for the uſe of the Rear, with the Artillery, Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the like appurtenances; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, eight thouſand Foot, making the Groſs of the Rear.</p>
               <p>Then (as formerly in the Van) may be ordered to march four Cannons, four De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-Cannons, three Culverins, or Quart du Cannons; and laſtly, three Field-pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with all that belongs unto them, both of Powder, Shot, and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with the requiſite attendants.</p>
               <p>And after them, two thouſand Foot, to ſerve as a defence and coverture to all the Artillery of the Rear.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all, are to march five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, anſwerable to the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the point of the Van; who are to bring up the Rear, and to diſcover that part of the <hi>Campagnia</hi> that way; that ſo no un-foreſeen Alarms may be given by the Enemy, to any conſiderable loſs.</p>
               <p>And in this order may an Army on all ſides be ſufficiently provided in a march againſt all attempts; eſpecially when the Enemy is not in view, but ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:191816:71"/>
               <p>But if the Enemy be in view, and an aſſault to be expected, and the Army ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs of neceſſity to march, and this befall in a large Plain or Champion Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; this order now deſcribed is to receive ſome alterations. For it will be needful to have a large Front of Pikes, being ten or ſix deep in File, with wings of Shot on each ſide, the which all together are to make an equal Front; between which Shot and Pikes the Artillery is to march in the intervals. And in the midſt, right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Cannon, or Artillery, may march two Bodies of Pikes, and betwixt them the Carriages or Baggage. And laſt of all, in the Rear of all, may be ordered a Body of Pikes, with diviſions of Shot on each ſide, equalizing with thoſe of the Front; and on each ſide of them, ſome Troops of Horſe, to ſerve as wings to this Body of the Rear.</p>
               <p>And in this Form and Order an Army may both march, and if need be, fight, without being diſordered or much impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in its way. For if the Enemy ſhall charge in Front, this order may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and receive the Enemies charge, be it either of Horſe or Foot, by the Front
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:191816:71"/>of Pikes; and the Shot in the wings ſhall oportunely gall them in the mean time, and the Artillery alſo give them a Salve as they make up; and both Shot and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non be well ſecured, either by the Pikes, if the Enemies Foot ſhall charge; or by the Horſe in the Rear, which are to advance if the Enemie charge with his Horſe. And if the Enemy charge in any of the Flanks, it may be ſuſtained by thoſe Pikes which march there, if his charge be with Foot; and withal, he ſhall be galled by the ſhot both of Van and Rear: and if his charge be with Horſe, it may be oppoſed by the Horſe marching in the Rear, who are to advance to that end. And if the Enemy give on in the Rear, his Foot may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (with Faces about) by the Body of Pikes which are ordered there, and alſo be much annoyed by thoſe Shot flanking thoſe Pikes; and the Shot well ſecured, as well by their own Pikes, as the Pikes in the Flank; and eſpecially by the Horſe marching in the Flanks of this Rear. And all this while, the Carriages of Baggage and Munition may likewiſe be very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſecured, by their being ordered to march in the very center of the Body of Pikes.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:191816:72"/>
               <p>But becauſe it may fall out upon occaſions either of paſſages, or ways, or preſent work and employment, that the Train of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be forced to march by it ſelf apart, and ſevered from the main Body of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; in this caſe the order and conduction of it may be, that half the Pioneers and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers make the Van, marching under their Chiefs and Commiſſaries, and to be freed from the trouble of any ſtrangers not belonging to their Train, nor with any of their Waggons. After which Pioneers, all ſuch Waggons are to march, as carry the Spades, Mattocks, and the like Utenſils. Next unto theſe, the Field-pieces are to follow; after them the Culverins, then the Demy-Cannons, and laſtly the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. And thus ordered marcheth the Vant-Guard: and in the very ſame order may alſo march the Rear. And after the Cannons in the Rear, may follow all the Furniture belonging to the Artillery; and with it the Bridges, the Boats, the reſerve of the Munitions, and eſpecially the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of Powder, the Tents in general, and the Generals Tents. Though true it is, that theſe are ſometimes ordered to march in the Van, that ſo they may be firſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:191816:72"/>in the Quarters, the better to be fitted for receit and entertainment. After theſe are to march all the Fire-works, all the Ladders, Planks, Chains, Nails, and Sacks, and the like implements. And after them, the reſt of the Pioneers and Miners, followed with the Waggons of ſmall ſhot, with the Store of Lead, with thoſe of the Pikes and Arms to ſpare. And then the Waggons of the great ſhot; the which, though properly they are to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to march next after the great Guns, yet in reſpect that the ſmall ſhot, and other ſmall parcels, are more ſubject to the pillage of the Common Souldier, they may beſt be ſecured in this manner. And in the laſt place are to come up the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons belonging to the General of the Ordnance, his Lieutenants, with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Officers of that Train. And then again the Smiths and Carpenters. And in rear of all, the Provoſt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery is to march, together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Baggage, and the Victuals of the whole Train.</p>
               <p>And thus may the Artillery belonging to a great Army march in good ſafety, in all common paſſages, and in a large and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:191816:73"/>open Country, ſeveral and apart by it ſelf. And if it ſhall be thought that the Train will hereby be over-lengthened, it may be helped by dividing it into three parts; but in ſuch a manner, that the Vant-Guard may take the right hand, the Battel the left, equalling the Front with the Van; and the Rear-Guard, with the Ordnance and their appurtenances, to march betwixt them both. And hereby alſo, the whole Train marching the more cloſed, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſtronger and readier; and every man prepared to know, and fall into his proper rank and place, without the leaſt confuſion.</p>
               <p>As for the conduction and ordering of the general Carriages and Baggage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to an Army when it is to march: It hath been found (as well with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients as Moderns) to be diſponed in five ſeveral parts: As, either before the Army, when there was a ſuſpicion of the Enemies charging in the Rear; or behind, when the Army was led towards the Enemy; or on the one Flank, when there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to be charged on the other; or in the center of the Battel, when a charge was looked for on all ſides. And thus
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:191816:73"/>much touching the ordering of an Army in its marching thorough a plain and champion Country: it remaineth to ſpeak ſomewhat about the conduction of an Army over Rivers, and the like. In which caſe, if the Enemy be in appearance, or near unto the Rear, it will be fit in the firſt place to paſs over ſome ſix or eight Pieces of the ſmaller ſorts of Ordnance, and ſo to lodge them on the other ſide of the River, under good covertures, that they may fully diſcover and play upon that part whence the danger is expected. But withal, a large half Moon is to be raiſed on the oppoſite ſide; wherein the reſt of the Ordnance are ſo to lie mounted, that they may play upon all the approaches of the Enemy, and withal flanker their friends, and ſo favour them in their paſſage: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the which interim, thoſe Pieces on the further ſide are likewiſe to be kept in continual play; that ſo the Enemy may not, without apparent hazard, approach the Rear of the Army. And if there be any ſuſpicion of the Enemies falling upon the very tail of the Rear, ſome ſmall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment is to be made, wherein ſome ſmall Pieces may be lodged, and guarded
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:191816:74"/>with a convenient number of Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, who are there to ſtay and make good the place, until the Army be paſſed over the River; and then themſelves are laſt of all to take their paſſage in the laſt Boats, under the favour of thoſe Guns planted at the firſt on the further ſide of the River.</p>
               <p>And in this manner did that famous Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> make his paſſage with his Army over the deep River <hi>Wale,</hi> when <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> with his Army fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him a long march in his Rear.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſay may an Army make his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage over a River with Boats, with good ſecurity, though an Army of Enemies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it in the Rear. But if an Enemie lie on the further ſide of the River, of purpoſe to hinder the paſſage of an Army over it, then that courſe is very approvable, which in the like caſe was put in practice by that ſuper-eminent Commander the King of <hi>Swedeland</hi> (when <hi>Tilly</hi> was on the further ſide of the River to oppoſe him) who to that purpoſe made choice of a point of land, (ſo made by the ſerpentine bending of the River that he was to paſs over) the bank whereof, on the ſide where the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:191816:74"/>Kings own Army lay, being a Pikes length higher then was that on <hi>Tillies</hi> ſide; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo plain and without covert, but the Enemies ſide Woodie and cloſe. Upon this point the King cauſed a running Trench to be caſt up round about; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Muſqueteers were ſo lodged, that out of it they might with good ſecurity give fire into the oppoſite Wood, where <hi>Tilly</hi> with his Army lay in covert. And the ſame Line or Trench had a great Battery beſides at each end of it, whereon ſome Demy-Cannons and Culverins were mounted, with many leſſer Batteries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, for ſome ſmaller Pieces all alongſt the point; the which alſo were every where lined and intermingled with Muſqueteers. The Bridge for the paſſage of the Kings Army (for by a Bridge they were forced to paſs) was made with Planks and the like materials. The means to ſupport this Bridge, was by certain ſtrong Treſſels, whoſe feet were long enough to fathom the depth of the River. And theſe Treſſels had great ſtones made faſt to their legs, wherewith to ſink them: and the length of the Treſſels were proportioned to the juſt depth of the River in every place
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:191816:75"/>where they were to be placed: ſo that the Planks upon the uppermoſt part of the Bridge were to lie almoſt even with the ſurface of the water.</p>
               <p>The Bridge thus fitted and laid over, the Kings Pioneers were inſtantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to paſs over upon it, and caſt up a ſmall Half Moon, with a Palliſado fitted unto it upon that ſide of the River: the which works were ſo contrived, as that they did anſwer in every particular thoſe of the Enemies made for his Muſqueteers; and withal ſerved to cover the Bridge, and to latch ſuch great ſhot as ſhould be made upon the Bridge. And theſe Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers were ſecured in their workings by the Cannons and Muſqueteers of their Party, lodged on the oppoſite ſide of the River.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſons inducing to the choice of the Part, and the manner of the Works, were, in that the crookedneſs and ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine courſe of the River did afford a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie, by flanking it on every ſide to defend the Bridge, being laid over juſt upon the point of land; ſo that it could not be touched by any of the Enemies Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, though they were on each ſide
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:191816:75"/>thereof: becauſe by the ſudden ſhoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the bank of the River at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, none of the Enemies Cannon could bear or beat upon the Bridge, but that either the bullets fell ſhort, being latched by the Half Moon aforeſaid, and the heighth of the bank of the River; or elſe flew quite over the Kings Leaguer, and ſo did no execution. By which means the Kings Army paſſed over ſafely; and being over, routed the Enemy, and killed their General, that brave old man.</p>
               <p>And thus you have ſome rules and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements about the conduction of an Army over Rivers, by Boats and Bridges. But if an Army be to paſs over a River by a Foord, and an Enemy ready to reſiſt on the further ſide; As it is to be known that that Army runs a great hazard which is thus put to it, ſo is it not to be practiſed but upon moſt urging cauſes, and then with all cautions poſſible; among which, I ſhall propound theſe following: That in the paſſage, the moſt of the Horſe be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to paſs in the Front, and the Foot to march cloſe up after them; for the Horſe are better able and provided to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the Enemies reſiſtance at their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:191816:76"/>then the Foot; who muſt needs be much encumbred and tired by their wading thorow the water, and eſpecially if the Foord be broad or deep. And beſides, the Horſe thus marching in Front, ſhall opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely diſcover the condition of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, where it is at beſt and worſt; and may alſo be ready to relieve and ſuccour any of the Foot that by any accident may be endangered in the water. And this was <hi>Caeſars</hi> order in his Britiſh War, in his paſſage over the River of <hi>Thames;</hi> and at the River <hi>Sicoris</hi> in his Spaniſh War. And if the Foord be deep, and withal of a ſwift current, it will be neceſſary to place a great number both of Horſe, and other great Cattle, as well above the part where the Army is to Foord it, as alſo below; for hereby the Horſe that ſtand above, will break the force of the Current; and the Horſe that ſtand below, may ſuccour and take up any ſuch as ſhall happen to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſwayed by the force of the ſtream; and withal, add courage to the Souldiers in general to adventure. And this courſe was practiſed by <hi>Hannibal</hi> in a paſſage of his Army over the River <hi>Po,</hi> where in ſtead of Horſe, his Elephants were thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to this purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:191816:76"/>
               <p>A ſecond courſe to this end (but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more time, though with leſs peril) may be, to abate the depth of the Foord, and violence of the Current, by dividing the River into many Chanels. As <hi>Cyrus</hi> did the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> when he took <hi>Babylon</hi> from <hi>Baltazzer;</hi> and <hi>Semiramis</hi> the ſame River (if we credit <hi>Herodotus</hi>) long before: as afterwards <hi>Alexander.</hi> Neither hath this practice been altogether amongſt the Ancients; for at the laſt ſiege of the Town of the <hi>Borſe,</hi> when the States took it in, that ſmall River that ran through the Town, was ſo diverted, that the Town was not only ſtreightned in point of water, but all ſuch Paſſages and Avenues drowned, as might have facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Reliefe from abroad, and the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon the Town it ſelf made by far more eaſie and acceſſible.</p>
               <p>As for the kindes of Bridges proper for theſe conveyances of Armies over Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whereof we ſpake of one even now: Of theſe there are many ſorts; but thoſe moſt in uſe, and indeed moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as are made upon flat-bottom Boats or Punts, whereſoever theſe are to be procured. But withal, whatſoever the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:191816:77"/>Bridges be, or howſoever contrived, it is to be received for a Maxime, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever an Army is to paſs over any of them, and the Enemie within the diſtance of half a days march; no part of the Army ought to be ſevered from the main Body, that no advantage may be taken by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, to intercept or come between them and their Friends. And this holds not onely in the paſſages by Bridges, but by Boats, or Foords, or any other.</p>
               <p>And thus you have directions for the marſhalling of Armies in a march. And theſe well obſerved, though an Army ſhould be forced to march even by night, need no other additions, ſave onely that extraordinary care be had in providing a ſufficient number of able Guides, which are to be diſtributed throughout the whole Army: That a well choſen Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word be given, whereby every Piece and individual Perſon may be known one to another: That many Altes be made, to hold all the parts together, and no Strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers loſt: That the quantity and length of the march be ſo laid, and with that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion limited, that the Souldiers be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſabled by over-long journeys, nor
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:191816:77"/>oportunities loſt by ſickneſs: and laſtly, that eſpecial endeavour be practiſed to procure good intelligence of the Enemies proceedings.</p>
               <p>As for ſuch marches as are to be made over Mountains, thorow Woods, and Bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Mariſh grounds, and the like; it is not to be expected that any certainty can be preſcribed, as touching their forms; for they are to be accommodated to the ground and ways that neceſſity throws them upon; and commonly are extended in great lengths, made paſſable by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Pioneers, but beſt ſecured by vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN the laſt foregoing Chapter we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſome directions how Armies
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:191816:78"/>were to march. In this we ſhall ſpeak of the forms of embattelling them to fight; and ſhall purpoſely omit many ſorts of them, as being to little or no purpoſe, ſave to expreſs the cunning of a curious Serjeant-Major-General, and to pleaſe wanton Spectators; but ſhall apply my ſelf to ſuch as are moſt of uſe.</p>
               <p>The cuſtomary way of ordering an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-Royal to a Battel, as well Anciently as more Modernly, hath been to divide it into three Battaliaes, or main Bodies: and theſe three Bodies have been, and yet are, (by ſome Nations) ordered into one joint Phalanx: by others diſtributed into maniples, or ſmall diviſions. Between which diviſions, for the prevention of ſome confuſions, they leave intervals or diſtances, that by them, and through them, one Battel or Body may the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſecond the other. And the breadth and depth of theſe maniples are to be made anſwerable to the Enemies forces, and the nature of the ground; but with ſuch diſtances, that if the Vant-guard ſhould happen to be broken, it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently retreat thorow them behind the Battel; which thereupon is to joyn and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:191816:79"/>advance, and ſo to renew the Front, and receive the Enemy afreſh. And in the like manner, upon the like occaſion, is the Battel to do behind the Rear. And as the one Body is thus relieved by another, ſo may one maniple by another, and that without either the advancing or retire of the whole Body.</p>
               <p>As for the Leaders of theſe ſeveral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, thoſe of the Vant-guard are to be, the Lord Marſhal, with the one half of the Colonels, and half of the Captains, having the beſt men in the Front. And in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, the ſame men are to bring up that Rear.</p>
               <p>The Leaders of the Battel, and of the Rear, are to be the other half of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels and Captaius. As for the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo's place (according to this order) it is to be between the Battel and the Rear; and that as well in regard that it is the place of moſt ſecurity, as that upon all occaſions his advice and command may there be beſt given and taken. And the Enſignes are to be ordered into the midſt of the Maniples, or ſomewhat nearer the Front. As for the Artillery, it is to be ordered before the Front, without the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:191816:79"/>of the Vant-guard, upon the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ground, that it may the better play upon all parts. Only if the Enemy be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to charge on all parts, then is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery to be placed on all parts: and ſuch Pieces as are not for the preſent employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be beſtowed between the Battel and the Rear; unleſs the fight be before a Town, or Camp entrenched, and then it is left either in the Town or Camp; and ſo is the Baggage likewiſe, and all the unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſons.</p>
               <p>But this ordering of an Army for a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, hath not paſſed without reprehenſion in divers particulars.</p>
               <p>As firſt of the Phalanx, and indeed all other over-great Bodies: for it being an undeniable Maxime, that thoſe Troops ſtand in beſt order which can bring up moſt hands to fight at once; it as undeniably followeth, that the ſmaller Troops and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions muſt needs do this beſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are preferable: Becauſe in great Squadrons or Phalanxes, many men are drowned in the depth of the Files and Flanks, and never appear but when the breaking of the great Body doth preſent them to the Butcherie. The great Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:191816:80"/>are alſo reprovable, in regard that they are unmanagable, and cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in order but when the ground is large and plain, and withal of an even and perfect level; otherwiſe they muſt either ſtand immovable, or upon the leaſt motion be ſubject to ſhaking and diſorder; whereas the leſſer Bodies are ſcantled for all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, champion or woodie, level or uneven, of what condition ſoever. Again, if two or three ranks onely of the great Bodies happen to be broken, or any way diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the whole Body is equally intereſſed in the diſorder, and hath far leſs means to rally it ſelf, then a ſmall maniple: whereas on the contrary, if any violence rout or diſorder a maniple, it proceedeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to that part where it taketh; the diſranking of any one of theſe ſmall Bodies, not at all, or very little extending to the confuſion or diſorder of any of the reſt: by reaſon that their intervals and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations or diſtances ſerve to cut off ſuch inconveniencies, and yet no way hinder the general uniting of all their ſtrength into one Body. And theſe are the exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions againſt great Bodies, and united Phalanxes.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:191816:80"/>
               <p>The ſecond exception againſt the former order, is about the placing of the General himſelf between the Battel or Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, and the Rear-guard, as the former order preſcribes. Concerning which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding many opinions are to be found, and various Preſidents; <hi>Vegetius</hi> (in his third Book and eighteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) ſaith, that the General of the Army is accuſtomed to be in the right Wing, betwixt the Horſe and the Foot. And he addeth, This is the place which governeth the whole Battel, as from whence all ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyings out are direct and free; ſo that (ſaith he) the General reſting thus betwixt the Horſe and Foot, may beſt govern them with commands and directions. Now of both theſe there have been found exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: of the firſt, <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it was the manner of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> that the King ſhould be in the middle of the Phalanx. And <hi>Arrian</hi> (in his firſt Book and thirty ſixth Chapter) affirmeth that <hi>Darius</hi> took the ſame place. And <hi>Leo</hi> alſo (<hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect</hi> 63. and 67. and <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 66.) giveth the middle of the Battel to the General. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that <hi>Timoleon</hi> in his fight againſt the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:191816:81"/>
                  <hi>Carthaginians</hi> placed himſelf in the very midſt of the Battel.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, we have it in <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon (Cyrop. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 176.) that <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his Battel againſt <hi>Croeſus,</hi> took his place in the right Wing, betwixt the right hand of the Battel, and that of the Horſe that were ordered in the Wing. And <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> (though bred amongſt the Phalangers) did the like in moſt of his Battels. And for the Moderns, I find the valiant King of <hi>Sweden</hi> at the battel of <hi>Liptzwick,</hi> in the right Wing, in the Front of ſome Brigades of Horſe; and at the Battel of <hi>Lutzen,</hi> in the very Front of the right Wing of his Vant-guard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſix Horſe-Squadrons, lined with five Bodies of Muſqueteers.</p>
               <p>For mine own part, as (amongſt theſe various opinions) I cannot approve of the Generals placing himſelf in the midſt of the Middle-guard or Center of the main Body of Pikes, in regard that it neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth valour, nor can he ſee about him to diſcover any advantages or diſadvantages, and to direct accordingly; ſo on the other ſide, I ſhall not adviſe to have any Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to be over-hazardous in adventuring
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:191816:81"/>his perſon in the very heighth of the Front, eſpecially when the Army falls up to the charge, leſt the loſs of the beſt bloud of that body, procure the languiſhing of the whole. And thus I am ſure was loſt at <hi>Lutzen</hi> the beſt General of the World, though (to the wonder of the World) that headleſs Army got the day in a fury.</p>
               <p>In mine opinion therefore, though a General may place himſelf (at the time of a battel) in the right Wing of his own Middle-guard, yet ought it to be with ſome Brigades of Reſerve: and by no means in the very Point or Poſt of the Van. For queſtionleſs it is a great errour in a General, when his courage ſhall not ſuffer his judgment to diſtinguiſh betwixt the duties of a common Carabine and the General of an Army.</p>
               <p>As for the lining of the Horſe with Muſqueteers, or at the leaſt with the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, (whereof we gave a touch before) it was not uncommon with the Ancients. And it was always held, that Horſe being thus charged, could not reſiſt both. And we have a notable example hereof in <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius (de Bello Afric.)</hi> when <hi>Caeſar</hi> having
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:191816:82"/>a march to make, and but a ſmall number of Horſe with his Legionary Souldiers, was ſet upon in his way by the Enemie, abounding with Horſe, and light-armed Numidians amongſt them. And when <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> Souldiers fell out to charge, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe retreated, and the Foot ſtood faſt, until their Horſe with a ſhort wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, returned upon the Rear of the Enemy to their reſcue: by which way of fight, <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf confeſſed, that he was ſo perplexed, that he found no other courſe to ſave himſelf, then to recover ſome hills of ſhelter near at hand; and that had it not been for them, he muſt have fared worſe. And for thoſe Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reers wherewith the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Horſe at the Battels of <hi>Liptzwick</hi> and <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> were lined, they were ſo ſhadowed from the Enemie by theſe Horſe, that when thoſe of the Enemies came up to the charge, they did a very great execution upon them before they were aware, and were a main means of the attainment of thoſe two famous Victories.</p>
               <p>Nor can I apprehend any objection that may (with any reaſon) be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this form of order; ſince hereby
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:191816:82"/>theſe Muſqueteers are well ſecured by their own Horſe, and the Enemies Horſe in extream danger to be terribly galled by theſe Fire-weapons before they can get up to charge home, or ſo much as to approach within the reach of their Piſtols. And therefore it ſeemeth to me very worthy both of acceptation and imitation.</p>
               <p>And theſe ways of lining of the heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed with the light-armed, have not been found to be practiſed with the Horſe onely, but with the Pikes alſo; and that as well with the Ancients, as thoſe of our time. True it is, that theſe light-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the Ancients, were the Slingers and Darters, and were variouſly ordered; ſometimes before the Front of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx, or main body of the Pikes; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the Wings, ſometimes betwixt the Files of the armed, fronting in a right line with them; ſometimes in the Rear of the Battel of the Pikes (and of theſe <hi>Aelian</hi> makes mention, <hi>chap.</hi> 42.) and ſometimes alſo in a quite contrary way; as when theſe light armed were drawn into the midſt of the battel it ſelf. As for the uſual Modern ways, they are (as all know) to place and order the light-armed men,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:191816:83"/>which are the Muſqueteers, in the Wings, and ſometimes in the Front of the Battel of Pikes. And the Swediſh Diſcipline introduced an intermingling of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers with ſmall bodies and maniples of Pikes; the which, nevertheleſs, were ſo beſtowed in the Sections and Diviſions of thoſe bodies, as not to be diſcovered by the aſſaulting Enemies until they felt them.</p>
               <p>And ſurely (if the Garb of the Time would allow it) I ſee not, why ſome of our long-Bowe-men (which, as the World knows, have been the fame of our Nation) might not be employed in theſe ſervices, mixed together with our Muſqueteers; nor why they ſhould not execute to great purpoſe, eſpecially upon Horſe. And if ſome of them were ordered in the very Rear of the body of Pikes, they would not onely be ſhadowed from the view of the Enemy, but might be drawn up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any confuſion or trouble to any other part, as occaſion ſhould require; nay, ſtanding firm in the very Rear of all, they may, queſtionleſs, do very great ſervice, (and eſpecially before the Armies join) by delivering their Vollies of Arrows over
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:191816:83"/>all that ſtand before them; the which, as many of them as fall upon any Horſe-Troops, and with their barbed heads ſtick and hang faſt where they fall (as they will certainly do) they cannot chuſe but cauſe a mighty confuſion: nay, their very ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ground, in the way of a Horſe-Troop, muſt needs dazle their ſight, and amaze them. For I am clearly of their opinion, who hold that the long-Bowe is preferable to the Muſquet in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: In that many ranks of Archers, yea all of them, ſhould they ſtand ten in depth, may deliver their whole Vollie at once; whereas the Muſqueteers can do this with one rank onely at once; or at the moſt (after the Swediſh way) with three: as alſo, in regard that the arrow ſtrikes as well in deſcent, as at point-blank, the bullet onely at point-blank: In that the Bowe may far better be uſed in wet weather then the Muſquet, and is withal ſurer to take, whereas the Muſquet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fails in taking fire: In that the Bowe is undoubtedly more prevalent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the horſe then the Muſquet; for though a horſe be ſhot thorow with a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, he is yet for a while able to bear his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:191816:84"/>Rider, and to do ſervice; but if a barbed arrow do but hang in any part of a horſe, he becomes altogether unmanageable, and ſo unſerviceable. And laſtly, in that (as aforeſaid) though the arrow ſhould miſs its mark, yet its very ſticking in the ground (and eſpecially when a whole Volley doth ſo) proves not onely terrible to the horſe, but cumberſome both to horſe and man; and that in all grounds, and at all aſſaults.</p>
               <p>I know well, that in ſome particulars the Muſquet alſo is preſerable to the Bowe; as behind a Rampart, and thorow loop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes; and in that a good Muſquet duly charged, will carry point-blank to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of twelve ſcore, whereas an Archer (eſpecially now adays) can ſcarce ſhoot ſo far at random. It may be alſo that the Muſquet is more terrible, and ſcareth an un-accuſtomed man, more then the Bowe. But for all this, I know not but that they may both paſs in Cameradeſhip; nor do I know (all things conſidered) why the new invention of the Pike and Bowe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould find ſo little entertainment amongſt us as it hath done; unleſs it be, that now adays we have given over our
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:191816:84"/>ſelves to take up all things upon meer truſt rather then reaſon, though evidenced by demonſtration.</p>
               <p>But becauſe we have ſpoken much of the lining of Horſe with Muſqueteers in a battel, it may well be expected that ſomewhat ſhould be ſaid touching the placing and ordering of theſe Horſe: and of this I find the common and uſual way to be, to diſpoſe them in the Wings. Thus did <hi>Alexander</hi> at his paſſage over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Granicus,</hi> as <hi>Arrian</hi> recordeth, (<hi>lib.</hi> 2.) and <hi>Curtius (lib.</hi> 3.) So did <hi>Antigonus,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> hath it (<hi>lib.</hi> 19.) And ſo <hi>Ptolomie</hi> in his battel againſt <hi>Demetrius,</hi> as the ſame Author ſaith in the ſame Book. And in brief, all the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> unleſs ſome eſpecial cauſe urged an alteration, did the like. And ſo the <hi>Romanes</hi> alſo, ſince them. And indeed ſo it hath continued almoſt in all ages, even to this.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, I hold it not amiſs, upon many occaſions, to place and order ſome Troops of Horſe in the very Rear of the Army; provided that ſome large inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals be left in the diviſions of the bodies of the Foot, that thorow them theſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:191816:85"/>Horſe may be drawn up to charge, when need requires: for hereby theſe Horſe ſhall both be ſhadowed from the Enemies ſight, and may be drawn to a charge in any part of the Army whereſoever. And of this alſo, we find both old and new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; as of old in the War between the <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> mentioned by <hi>Livie (Cecab.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 9.) wherein the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetanes,</hi> the <hi>Illergetes,</hi> with ſome others, are ſaid to leave broad intervals betwixt the Wings and the middle part of their Battel, to give paſſage to their Horſe to come up to all charges. And I find the like likewiſe to be practiſed by the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in the battel of <hi>Liptzwick,</hi> where he ordered divers Reſerves of Horſe in the Rears, whence they were drawn up, and did very good ſervice, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the atchievement of that famous Victory. Sometimes alſo it hath been found, that the Horſe have been ordered in the Front of the body of Pikes. But I believe that this was onely done when that ſide did much exceed the other in number and ſtrength of Horſe, and when there was ſome diſtruſt in the worth of the Foot. As in that battel between <hi>Eumenes</hi> and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:191816:85"/>
                  <hi>Craterus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Plutarch</hi> (in <hi>Vita Eumenis</hi>) where <hi>Eumenes</hi> placing the Horſe before his Foot, did it (ſaith the Author) becauſe he held them the prime of his ſtrength; and therefore put upon them the hazard of the day: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhewed himſelf both in counſel and action, a brave and well-experienced General.</p>
               <p>As for the beſt forms and faſhions of Horſe-battels, the moſt ancient, and then the moſt common, was that of a <hi>Rhombe.</hi> And this was in ſpecial account with the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> (witneſs <hi>Aelian, cap.</hi> 18.) who were reckoned for the beſt Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Greece,</hi> (as <hi>Xenothon</hi> reports them in his <hi>Hist. Graec. lib.</hi> 7. 644. <hi>D.</hi>) and held that account to the time of King <hi>Pyrrus.</hi> And for this form, theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are given: That it was fitteſt for all Encounters, becauſe the Horſe thus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtured, were ready to turn Faces about any way, upon all occaſions: That it could not be ſurpriſed in Flank or Rear, as having the beſt and choice men in the Flank, and the Commanders in every point of the <hi>Rhombe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the practice of our days conſiſts
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:191816:86"/>moſt in the ordering of the Horſe into ſquare Bodies. And the grounds hereof are, That theſe forms are with moſt eaſe and facility to be put in order: That they are apteſt for the joynt movings of the Horſe: And that the Commanders do joyntly charge the Enemy in the Front; which in no form can be done but this.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak freely of both theſe forms, I opine with them who hold that the <hi>Rhombe</hi> in point of piercing, and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial breaking into the battel of an Army, is the moſt proper, (unleſs perhaps that a Wedge be in the ſame caſe to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;) for being narrow and pointed in the Front, it naturally forceth a paſſage with the point, and withal maketh way for the reſt of the Body to follow; and ſo without much ado, piercing farther and farther, it muſt neceſſarily hazard the breaking of the adverſe Battel, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe it, that afterwards execution may be done at pleaſure. On the other ſide, the ſquare Horſe-battel in reſpect of doing execution, and violent overthrowing of all in its way, is to be preferred before any other; for it bringeth more hands to fight, and beareth down all things before
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:191816:86"/>it. So that I ſee not but both theſe forms of Horſe-battels may be held in uſe, even in theſe times; the one for entrance, the other for bearing down; this for a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row execution, that for a diſperſion.</p>
               <p>But there is one thing more in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Horſe-battels of eſpecial obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that is their depth; of which <hi>Leo</hi> his opinion was (<hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>ſect.</hi> 40.) that a Horſe-battel was onely to be four in depth; and his reaſons were, that (bearing Lances) the fifth was unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe from thence their Lances could not reach to the Front; neither (ſaith he) can Horſe (as Foot) with their thickneſs or depth, thruſt one another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from behind; and therefore in his opinion, the number of four was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the depth in File. And yet we find in <hi>Polybius,</hi> that the Horſe was for the moſt part in his time, ordered eight in depth. But this was in the Age of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In our now Piſtol-world, I finde the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Horſe which were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Wings of the Van at the battel of <hi>Lipzwick,</hi> to be four in depth: And thoſe that were in the Wings of the Rear, to be five in depth; and ſo likewiſe were
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:191816:87"/>
                  <hi>Tillies</hi> Horſe. In the battel of <hi>Lutzen</hi> the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Horſe were in no place above three in depth; whereas <hi>Walsteins</hi> Horſe were every where ſix.</p>
               <p>It ſeems therefore, that there can be no certain rule touching this particular; but that it muſt be varied according to the number of Horſe, and the neceſſity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the fronts: ſo that <hi>Aelians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion may be received with moſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation for the general; which is, to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the number of the Front, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Flank; and as the number of the Troop ariſeth, to enlarge the length of the Front and the depth of the Flank proportionably one to another: yet would I not have it to exceed the number of eight at any time in depth, nor under four; for the one extream loſeth the fighting of ſome hands by reaſon of their over-depth, and the other is over-weak to ſuſtain any great ſhock.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add one thing more, which may concern both Horſe and Foot, concerning words of Command; touching which, I find, that it was the ancient uſe, (witneſs <hi>Polyen. lib.</hi> 4.217. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.) that when the Horſe were commanded to turn to the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:191816:87"/>right hand, the word of Command was, Turn to the Staff; that is, to that ſide where the Staff or Lance was then carried: and when they were to turn to the left hand, the word was, Turn to the Reins; becauſe the Reins were born in the left hand. And ſo to the Foot, the words of Command were of old, To the Pike, when they were to turn to the right hand; and to the Target, when they were to turn to the left. Now the preſent words of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to this purpoſe both to Horſe and Foot, are, To the right hand, To the left hand; To the right hand about, To the left hand as you were; To the left hand about, To the right hand as you were.</p>
               <p>Touching which, I ſhall onely offer it to the conſideration of our preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, whether it were not ſafer in this caſe to take up ſome other words of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, then thoſe that are now in uſe. And this in regard that our preſent words of Command, To the right hand, To the left hand, are ſubject to be miſtaken, as being of too alike ſound, and may very well be taken one for another. And all miſtakes of this kind muſt needs be very diſadvantagious, and carry with them much
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:191816:88"/>of peril, as all judicious men will readily confeſs. So that we may do well to be herein preſidented by our Sea-men, who in their Sea-words of Command for the Condeing of a Ship, uſe not to ſay Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the Helm, but Port the Helm, when they would have it to be put to the left ſide of the Ship; leſt by the affinity of the ſound, it ſhould be taken for Star-board the Helm, which is to have it to be put on the contrary ſide, and that in many caſes to a certain ruine. And this alſo may be the better perfected by <hi>Aelians</hi> rule, that the particular be placed firſt; as to ſay to the Horſe, To the right hand turn your Face, when you would have them turn to the right hand; To the Reins or Sword turn your Face, when they ſhould turn to the left hand. And to the Foot, to ſay, To the right hand turn your face, when they are to move that way: and To the Sword turn your faces, when you would have them move to the left hand.</p>
               <p>As for the words, Double your Files, or Ranks, or Length, or Depth: The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the length is to be uſed, either to over-wing the Enemy, or to avoid the over-winging of the Enemy; or elſe to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:191816:88"/>make the fairer ſhew and outſide of an Army; whereby to diſ-hearten the Enemy, and withal to deceive him. The doubling of the Files or Depth, to be done either in reſpect of the ſtraitneſs and narrowneſs of the place, or for the better ſtrengthening of the battel, or to draw an Enemy to fight when you have the advantage of him.</p>
               <p>And thus have you the Genuine uſes of both theſe kinde of doublings, as well in length as depth; wherein, nevertheleſs, due heed is to be taken, that in doubling of the Front there be not given ſo much length that it fail in its due depth; nor ſo much depth, that the Front be over-nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, and ſo ſubject to be environed: the want of length and depth in an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Army for a battel, being equally diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious and reprovable. For when it is embattelled over-ſhallow, it can endure no ſhock; when over-deep, it is eaſily encompaſſed, and in danger to be utterly ruined that way.</p>
               <p>To comply therefore with all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and provide againſt the defects, I ſhall deſcribe a modern form of embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling an Army for a fight, that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:191816:89"/>a very general approbation, and deſerves as general an imitation. And it is in this manner (ſuppoſing the Army to conſiſt of twenty thouſand men, all other numbers being to be proportioned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:) in the Front of the Van are to be Wings of the beſt Troops of Horſe, to be ſomewhat advanced before the main Front of the foot of the Van: Theſe Horſe to be divided into ſeveral maniples or ſmall bodies, and the Diviſions to be well lined with Muſqueteers. The Van of the Battel or Middle-Guard to be ordered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four Brigades of Pikes and Muſqueteers, the middle Front of every Brigade being to be ſomewhat advanced; before which part the Artillery is to be placed; and to ſecure it, three diviſions of Muſqueteers, with ſome Troops of Horſe near unto them, are to be ordered immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde theſe four Brigades: and all theſe bodies are to be well lined with Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers in every one of their Diviſions: and for a ſtrength to theſe alſo, ſome Cannons may be placed in the Rear of them all. In the Rear of the right Wing, is to be placed rwelve Troops of Horſe, and as many in the Rear of the left Wing. As
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:191816:89"/>for the Rear of the main Battel or Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Guard, it is to be ordered into three Brigades of Foot; the which are to ſerve for a Reſerve of that Body. And every middle Front of each Brigade to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what advanced, as thoſe in the Van. And in the Rear of all theſe, two half Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe, of five Troops apiece.</p>
               <p>Now the grounds of this order of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelling of an Army for a battel, are theſe: That every part of it conſiſting thus of ſeveral maniples, and ſmall Bodies, if any one of them ſhould happen to be broken, yet is there not ſo much danger any thing near, as when an Army is ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into great Battalions; becauſe they may with far more eaſe (by reaſon of the agility of their motion, as being little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the ſmall piece of ground which they take up to move in) be reſtored and ſupplied, then a main great Body can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be. Secondly, In that though the thinneſs of the Files (which are ſaid to be at the beſt, when they are not above ſix in depth) may not perhaps be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any main ſhock or force; yet by this order ſhall more hands be brought up to fight at once, then can be in great Bodies;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:191816:90"/>and ſhall alſo be more able to do execution on the ſudden. Thirdly, In that in this order every part ſo fenceth, flankers, and backs one another, and is ſo apt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, relieve, and ſupport one another; ſo ready either to ſend out ſupplies, or to receive them, as that the whole Body looks like ſome Maſter-Piece of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and indeed, becomes ſo, having (as it were) its Baſtils, Towers, Bulworks, and ſeveral Retreats. So that though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral and individual perſons may chance to be laid on the ground, yet ſhall the whole order be preſerved from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſ-joynted, and much more the great Body of the Army from being routed.</p>
               <p>Thus I have laid down a forme of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging an Army for a Battel, which ſome have ſtiled Admirable. And yet I muſt tell you, that it hath not been free from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; and thoſe made by ſome old Souldiers, or at the leaſt, Souldiers of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der time. For firſt, they ſay, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that private Companies cannot hold long in their full ſtrength and due numbers, being in the Field, by reaſon of ſickneſs, ſlaughter, and the like accidents;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:191816:90"/>that thus to order an Army into ſmall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and as it were into private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Companies by themſelves, their Vollies of ſhot can neither be great, nor the harm great that the Enemy ſhall receive by them. But to this it may be anſwered, that we ſpeak not here of the ordering of particular Companies by themſelves, but of ſmall Bodies made up of private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, as cauſe ſhall require: ſo that though it be true that the ſtrength of the Army may be weakned by theſe accidents of death, or otherwiſe, yet the diviſions may ſtand faſt and full: Though it is as true, that there will be fewer Diviſions; which makes nothing againſt the order in general.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe Objectors ſay, That the mixing of the Shot and Pikes together in diſtinct Companies, weakneth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth the whole Body: for (ſay they) by caſting off the Shot in this manner, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals and ſtreets are made ſo empty and wide, that the Enemies Horſe are enabled to break in and diſorder them. And if the Shot be not thus caſt off, but kept cloſe, and ſo made to diſcharge in Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march, they are hereby apt to be thronged
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:191816:91"/>together by the Pikes; and the diſtance of place being taken from them, the uſe of their weapons alſo muſt needs fail them, and ſo all come to ruine.</p>
               <p>But to this Objection alſo it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That all this may be helped by the uniting of theſe bodies into one, as ſhall be found neceſſary: nor need theſe Shot be ſo removed from their Body of Pikes by any caſting off, but that they may be reunited with eaſe on a ſudden; nor ſhall they be thronged by their Pikes, or deprived of their diſtances of place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall not need (holding this order) to diſcharge at all in Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, it is objected againſt this foreſaid order of embattelling an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into ſmall Bodies, that in what manner ſoever the Shot be employed, there muſt needs be a weakneſs in the Rear, ſo that the Enemies Horſe may break in at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But to this it is again replied, that the uniting of the ſmall Diviſions being carefully obſerved, aſſureth againſt all theſe aſſaults and perils: And that all theſe objections fall rather upon the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelling of a ſingle Regiment, then the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:191816:91"/>forming of a Battel or Army made up of ten or twenty thouſand men. And thus much of the ranging and ordering of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for a fight: we ſhall in the enſuing Chapter give ſome Advertiſement touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diſlodgings, Retreats, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments of a Camp-Royal.</p>

               <p>Now in the firſt place the Provoſt-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal-General is to give order to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt-Marſhals of the Regiments, that they give Command to the Pioneers, Sucklers, and the reſt that are not Souldiers, to be in a readineſs, and employ themſelves in the filling up of the Trenches that they are to forſake, and in the firing of the Quarters (and this to be done whileſt the whole Camp are putting themſelves into their Arms;) that ſo nothing may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main entire, to give relief or any way to ſerve the Enemies turn after they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by themſelves.</p>
               <p>This being done, and the one half of the Scouts ſent before to make diſcoveries, that Corner or Wing of the Army which lay next to the Enemie, is firſt to ſtir, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the Body of the Vaunt-guard.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:191816:92"/>Then ſucceedeth the other Wing, and then marcheth the Battel, followed by the Artillery and Baggage, covered with the Rear-guard, cloſed with Troops of Horſe, ſerving withal as Scouts to the Army, and to beat up Stragglers.</p>
               <p>This hath been received for a general order of diſlodgings. But ſurely this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo preciſely and punctually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but may and muſt ſuffer alterations according to the quality and condition of the Country and Ground that the diſlodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be made in: for hereby an Army may ſometimes be forced to march in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ranks, at another time have liberty to do it in an entire body; neither can the place of the Baggage be ſo aſcertained to be either before or after the Middle-guard, but that in ſome caſes it may better be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the Flank of the Army: provided that that Flank be the ſecureſt part: for the place of moſt ſecurity is always the moſt proper for the placing the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And thus much touching diſlodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an Army.</p>
               <p>As for the ordering of Retreats, it is to be done in Battalia if the ground will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, when the Enemy is in ſight, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:191816:93"/>in Front. And in the firſt place the Rear is to march off; and whileſt they turn fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about from the Enemy, the Van and Battel are to ſtand their ground, as ready to receive all charges. This done, the Battel or Middle-guard is to move, and in all points to obſerve the orders and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fore-practiſed by the Rear: and in the mean time the Van to make a ſtand; and when the Rear and Middle-guard have again made Alt, the Van it ſelf is to retreat, and to have the Wings of the Horſe at the ſame time to move and flank with it. And leſt the Enemy ſhould charge upon the Rear, ſome numbers of Muſqueteers, with ſome Cornets of Horſe, are to man it. And thus may a whole Army maintain and continue a Retreat, ſo long as the Enemy ſhall continue in a purſuit, and the ground be a Champian.</p>
               <p>But if an Army in the retreat, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my following, be to paſs through any nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, as upon Dikes, thorow Lanes, over Bridges; in this caſe, aſſoon as any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the Foot is entered any of theſe ſtreights, the Horſe are to paſs in the Rear of that firſt Diviſion: and in the room whence theſe Horſe departed, a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:191816:93"/>ſtrong ſtand of Pikes well flanked with Muſqueteers are to make it good againſt the Enemies Horſe, and to ſtand firm and keep their ground. And for the bringing off of theſe Pikes and Shot, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that ſome Breſt-work, or half Moon, or both, be caſt up at the point of the entrance upon the narrow, wherein Muſqueteers are to be lodged; and if cauſe require, ſome ſmall Field-pieces, as Drakes or the like, to beat upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at his approach, and make good the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. The which ſmall Pieces may be brought off upon the Narrow in the Rear of all, upon their proper Carriages, with their muzzles towards the Enemy, and upon all occaſions to be guarded and ſecured by the Pikes, in whoſe Rear they retreat.</p>
               <p>Now the grounds and motives of this Order, are, That though during a retreat in a champian and open ground, the Horſe may be ordered to come up and retreat in the Rear; becauſe with a ſmall wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, they may advantagiouſly charge the Enemies Horſe in Flank, if they ſhould attempt to fall on upon that Rear; and the Rear of the Foot alſo, with faces
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:191816:94"/>about, may the whileſt receive the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies charge with the Body of their Pikes, and gall them with the Shot wherewith they are lined: Yet when an Army is to paſs in any ſtreight, theſe Horſe ſhall then beſt ſecure themſelves by wheeling about into that Rear of the Diviſion of Foot which hath firſt entered upon that ſtreight; for hereby a ſtand or alt may be made good againſt the charge of the Enemies Horſe by the reſt of the Pikes which are not entered upon the ſtreight; and theſe Pikes brought off under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Field-pieces and Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers in the half Moon, and behind the Breſt-work formerly mentioned; and they themſelves brought off under the protection of the laſt Rear of Pikes, and the Drakes, or Field-pieces in the Rear of them; to be ſecured partly by their own beating upon the Enemy as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and partly by the laſt Reſerve of Pikes and Shot, when he chargeth home.</p>
               <p>And the want of the making uſe of this order in our retreat at the Iſland of <hi>Rey,</hi> was the viſible cauſe of our miſcarrying in it. For all the while we marched in open ground, though all our Horſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:191816:94"/>in the Rear of our Foot, and the Enemy both in Horſe and Foot doubled our number, yet meddled they not with us, but made alt when we did, and marched when we did. But our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being got up to the narrow of the Dike betwixt the Salt Pans, and our Van and Middle-guard well entered upon the Dike, and the Front of our Rear ſo cloſe up with them, that our Horſe could not wheel to put themſelves betwixt the Rear of them, and the Front of our Rear; the Enemie did then furiouſly, French-like, charge with their Horſe upon ours, and being by far the greater number, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly routed them: forcing ſuch of our Horſe as ſought their ſafety by flight, to break in upon our own Foot, to their utter diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and the reſt of our Horſe, that could not do ſo, were all either taken or ſlain. The execution likewiſe upon our Foot became hereby very great; and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by reaſon that there were no kindes of Works caſt up to command the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the paſſage upon the Dike: So that the Enemy was emboldned to charge home all alongſt the way of our march, upon the very Dike it ſelf, even to the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:191816:95"/>very Bridge that we were to paſs over; where alſo, by reaſon of the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in making it without rails on the ſides, our men in the haſte and terrour of their diſorder, thruſt one another into a Creek of the Sea, and were there ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the water and mud. And here it was that we loſt the moſt and beſt of our men.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe in theſe Retreats it may fall out, even with the moſt provident Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, that an Army may be forced to lie and lodge in the open Field very near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Enemy; it will not be amiſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome courſes touching this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. And in this caſe it hath been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that every Regiment ſhould lie down and lodge in the very ſame order that they marched all the day before, with all their Arms by them: the Pikes to ſtick up an end cloſe by the bearers as they lay; and every Rot or File (that is, every ſix) of Muſqueteers, to bring their Muſquets to their Rot-maſters or leaders of their File, who were to ſee them ſet with their mouths upright, and ſo bound together with a piece of Match, that they might ſtand ready at hand upon all alarms. As for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:191816:95"/>the perſon of the General himſelf, and the Officers of the Field, they were to beſtow themſelves in their Coaches, or the like; and the private Captains to make uſe of ſuch kinde of frames of wood as in the Low-Countries are termed Horſes, being very proper for that purpoſe; and of which, it is good for every Captain to have one. Touching the Horſe-Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, every man was to eaſe himſelf and his Horſe, by alighting, and reſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the ground, and by feeding his Horſe near unto him: And in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to take repaſt and ſleep; and ſo to attend the light of the enſuing morn, for the purſuance of their intended retreat. And thus having given ſome notes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diſlodgings and Retreats of an Army, we will finiſh this Chapter with ſome Rules touching Incampings.</p>
               <p>In theſe Incampings the General Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter is eſpecially to obſerve theſe particulars following: That friends (as near as may be) be lodged by friends; and this as well for preventing of tumults, as the faithful ſeconding one of another: That ſuch Horſe as are moſt unready and unfit for ſudden occaſions, be covered
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:191816:96"/>with Foot for three parts of them at leaſt: That no impediments, as Merchants, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallers, Artificers, be lodged amongſt the Souldiers: and That the Camp be well entrenched.</p>
               <p>And becauſe an Army, be it never ſo well entrenched, lying thus, will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſend Forragers abroad, it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Providence, (and eſpecially if the Enemy be any thing near) that ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient number of Troops do by turns ſtand by their Arms, that they be always ready to anſwer all alarms: which is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furthered, and a Reſcue the ſooner and with leſs diſmay performed, when ſome Captains are thus found always in point, and ready to march at the firſt word of Command. And hereof we have a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual example at <hi>Caeſars</hi> firſt landing in this our Iſland. For he having received a great loſs in his Shipping by a Tempeſt, the which encouraged the Britains ſo much the more to oppoſe him; the which himſelf alſo ſuſpecting, he cauſed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be ſtrongly entrenched: And ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out one of his Legions in its turn to fetch in Corn, the Enemy on a ſudden aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted it; the which being diſcovered by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:191816:96"/>an unuſual duſt, <hi>Caeſar</hi> inſtantly took two Cohorts (which might amount to the number of 720 men) which were in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the Ports of the Camp (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that other two ſhould ſupply their places) and led them on to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of the Legion that was abroad; the which he found in a dangerous fight with the Enemy: And without this oportune ſupply, had in all likelyhood been cut off; and was thus relieved.</p>
               <p>As for the Forms of Trenches, they are to be regulated, either by the advantage or diſadvantage of the ſite. Their flanks are to be diſtanced about ſeventy Paces one from another; Their depth, bredth, and heighth, according to the time and intention of ſtay in that place, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance of an Enemy: In them entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or paſſages are to be laid out for Horſe, Foot, and Carriages: And to be covered with Ravelins without, and Bars within. And theſe Trenches are to be furniſhed with convenient Artillery, ſo ordered and mounted, that being well flanked, they may command the <hi>Campagna</hi> round about. And beſides all this, the Camp is to be ſecured by ſtrong and vigilant Guards;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:191816:97"/>ſome whereof are the main Guards; the reſt the pettie Guards. One main-Guard is to be near the Generals Quarter, and the Commander thereof is ſtiled, The Captain General of the Watch. Another main-Guard is to be in every Regiment, which hath likewiſe its Captain; by whom the Rounds are laid out, and the Rounders ſent abroad to viſit the Guards of the Companies: and out of the Main-guard by the Generals Lodging, the Rounders are taken out to viſit all the petty Guards.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it may be dangerous when in one Diſcipline two Rounds meet in their Circuit, that they which ſpeak firſt in taking the Word of the other, may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by help the Enemie to rob the Word; To prevent it, it hath by ſome been thought a provident courſe, that the two elder Rounders ſhould make an exchange of their Companions, and ſo proceed to finiſh their Circuit without giving or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the word of any Round at all. The which I onely offer to our preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to take into their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As for the petty Guards, they are of two ſorts: for either they conſiſt of many
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:191816:97"/>perſons, and are then termed a Corps du Guard; or of one ſingle man, who is called a Centinel. A Corps du Guard may either be of Horſe (which is a Guard without the entrenchments of the Camp) or of Foot, who watch within, before or at the Ports of the Trenches, or any where elſe where the Ser jeant-Major ſhall hold it fit. In the ſetting out of the Centinels, it is to be obſerved that they be not placed over-far from any Corps du Guard, leſt by being ſurprized by an Enemy, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Army be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it cannot chuſe but be full of hazard, and ſubject to many caſualties, for an Army to be brought up any thing near to an over-powerful Enemy; a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral being to be exceeding circumſpect, and ſure of ſome advantage alſo, either by the place, or his own virtue that ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to do it: If nevertheleſs neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty force hereunto, it is a fit courſe for ſuch an Army to encamp and entrench it ſelf round about ſome good Town being to friend, eſpecially if that Town be withal a place of a paſs, and by its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vicinitie unto ſome other parts in amity with it, any other way advantagious;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:191816:98"/>for by this means both the Army and the Town may be well ſecured, and by the paſs both of them continually ſupplied with Victual and Munition.</p>
               <p>As touching the faſhion and form of the entrenchments to be practiſed in this caſe: In the firſt place the ground and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation of the utmoſt lines are to be well viewed and conſidered, whether it be capable for the whole Army to lodge in. And all ſuch higher grounds or hills as are any way near unto this circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are to be taken in and included, to prevent the Enemy from planting his Cannon upon them, and ſo to beat upon the Leaguer, or into the Town. Theſe entrenchments alſo are to be convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtored with Baſtions, and guarded with Flanks. And if there be any River paſſing thorough the part, both ſides thereof are to be commanded and well ſecured with Forts, or at the leaſt Baſtions: And (if it may be) the whole Work to be joined to ſome Fort erected within the Town it ſelf, or at the leaſt ſome Suburb thereof. And all theſe to be well defended with half-Moons and Horn-Works: The Suburbs themſelves likewiſe (eſpecially thoſe that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:191816:98"/>lie moſt in the Enemies way of approaches) being to be entrenched and guarded with ſome Works anſwering one unto another, and joining one upon another. The main High-ways alſo leading unto the Town are to be ſecured by ſome Forts, and ſome Batteries to be erected here and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, furniſhed with good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnance to play upon all the Avenues of the Enemy. As for the Graft or Moat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing the whole circumvallation of the Trenches, it ought to be twelve Foot in the bredth, and eight in depth; and at the head-Works, eighteen feet in wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and twelve deep.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the Incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, Quarterings, and Entrenchments of an Army; purpoſely omitting the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ways of lodging a particular Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is onely the diminutive of the other, and after the common way commonly known. And thus we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our ſecond Book.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:191816:99"/>of matter of Counſel, Advice, Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, and Martial Courts. Touching which, in regard of their variety, and the anſwerable dependants, I ſhall onely ſpeak of ſuch as may afford the moſt general uſe, and be moſt properly drawn into imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place I ſhall begin with ſome conſiderations needful to be taken before the War be entered upon.</p>
               <p>The Attempters of a War are therefore to deliberate concerning both their own Forces, and thoſe they are to deal with. They are diligently to inform themſelves of their Enemies Treaſures as well as their own; how raiſed, how maintained: and chiefly they are to conſult by what means he may be deprived of them, or of any part of them; and thereby weakned in thoſe main ſinews of Military ſtrength.</p>
               <p>The Enemies Militia as well by Sea as by Land, is likewiſe to be enquired into. And herein notice is to be gotten not onely of the number and value of his Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Boats, but of his Mariners and Sea-Commanders: and concerning his Land-force, what numbers of Horſe and Foot he is able to bring into the Field;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:191816:100"/>how armed, how diſciplined, of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and ſpirit; and to what Climate and Country enured, and how bred and brought up.</p>
               <p>Diligent and heedful enquiries are alſo to be made of what condition the Enemies Country is that is to be invaded: As, whether it be ſtrong by Nature, by reaſon of Woods, Mountams, Seas, Lakes, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Mariſhes; or artificially ſtrong, by Forts, Caſtles, and ſtrong Towns: of all which, the number, the ſite, the quantity of Munition, the number of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants in every ſtrength, and whether they be ſtrong by Nature or by Art, or by both, or by neither, are as much as may be to be known beforehand; that ſo the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations may be made accordingly.</p>
               <p>All theſe particular diſcoveries being thorowly made upon thoſe who are to be invaded, no leſs diligence is to be uſed by the Invader concerning his own prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and eſpecially in Monies, Muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Victual.</p>
               <p>And he may be ſaid to be well provided in the point of Victuals, when neither his Army in the Field need complain of ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor his Towns and Forts remain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:191816:100"/>And of Munition, when he hath not onely a ſufficiencie of great Guns for the Field, Sea, Batteries and Forts; but alſo Armour of all uſual kindes, with the Utenſils due to a War, as Powder, Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, Match, Engines, Balls, Gabions, Carriages, Beaſts for draught and labour, Bridges, Ladders, Planks, Spades, Shovels, Axes, Sacks, Baskets, Timber, Cables, Ropes, Handmills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides all theſe, fit and provident confederations are to be made with all ſuch foreign Princes and States as may either aſſiſt or hinder the War; either for Benefit, or Traffique, or for States-ſake, or for neceſſity of dependance, or for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance and conſanguinitie. For theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations being duly obſerved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, the difficulties will prove leſs, either for the maintenance of the War, or the making of a Peace, as occaſion ſhall at any time be preſented.</p>
               <p>The Juſtice likewiſe of the War ought to be divulged; and that for a ſatisfaction as well to the natural Subjects, as the neighbour-nations. And this may be done by a publication of the original cauſes: that War being to be allowed for Juſt,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:191816:101"/>which is (indeed, without falſe pretences) made for the true Religion, for juſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for repelling of publick wrongs by a foreign State after refuſals of redreſſes, in defence of Friends violently and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly oppreſſed: And that War Un juſt, which is taken up for private Ends, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Revenge and Empire.</p>
               <p>As touching ſuch Invaſions as are to be attempted by Sea and Shipping; whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intends them, is to aſſure himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand of ſome commodious and ſure Landing-places, that neither the Ships ſuffer wrack or eminent danger in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the coaſt, nor the Souldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur manifeſt hazard at their diſ-imbarque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And of the ſame importance is the fore-caſting of a ſafe place of retreat; if peradventure the Army ſhould be repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by extremity of weather, contagion of ſickneſs, or the ſtrength of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
               <p>And thus far concerning ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Counſels as are aforehand to be taken in point of an Invaſive War.</p>
               <p>As for ſuch as are to be practiſed in a War Defenſive, (though the ſureſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is Offence) yet ſuch as are forced
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:191816:101"/>unto it, are by all means to aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their neighbours by Leagues, or by proviſion of Treaſure to defray all charges, or by an Army ſo governed by diſcretion, that no fight be admitted in heat and raſhneſs; and yet ſo avoided, that the Army may not ſeem to forbear the battel for fear (which may utterly diſcourage the common Souldier, or encourage the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) but rather as done out of policie. And withal, that the Country be on all ſides waſted where the Enemy is to paſs; ſo that nothing may be found for him to make uſe of. And in the interim, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Army to be commodiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched, having withal a guard upon the Enemies Army on all ſides; that no relief, or as little as may be, may be brought unto it.</p>
               <p>This defenſive War may alſo be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the erecting of Forts, and the fortifying of Towns: for hereby the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants may not onely ſecure their lives from all ſudden irruptions, and keep ſhort the Enemy from relief, but defer battels at pleaſure, and thereby abate the Enemies heat and pride.</p>
               <p>As for the parts where theſe Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:191816:102"/>are to be raiſed, they are thoſe which may give the moſt impediment to the Enemies attempts, and moſt ſecurity to the Defendants; as upon the Sea-coaſts, the Ports and Landing places: and in the Mid-land parts, upon Narrows, and ſtreight paſſages, and the Capital Cities. And theſe Forts are not to be ſo great, but that they may be manned and furniſhed, as well with Munition as Men, without the weakning of the main Army in the field; nor to be ſo ſmall, but to be ſufficiently capacious to receive the Peaſants, and the beſt of their ſubſtance, in caſe of neceſſity.</p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:191816:102"/>the avoiding of Battels in caſe of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive War. But in this, we ſhall enlarge our advertiſements concerning that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>It hath been always a ſure maxime of War, that whenſoever by foreſight well grounded, Victory cometh towards one without blows, or wounds; as either by blocking up the paſſages, and ſo cutting off all ſupplies, or by any the like means; that in ſuch caſes an Enemie is not to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, nor admitted to the terms of a Battel: for it ſutes better with the worth of the ſpirit, and the eſſence of our nature, ſo to direct the courſe of an action, that an Enemy may be conquered rather by Wit then War.</p>
               <p>And hereof we have an example in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaries: where <hi>Caeſar</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhut up <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Petreius</hi> in a place of advantage, although he might have cut them to pieces by an aſſault, yet finding the Victory ſure without a fight, without blood, and without hazard; he thus anſwered his Captains who ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to ſtorm them, <hi>Cur ſecundo Praelio aliquos ex ſuis amitteret? Cur vulnerari pateretur, optime de ſe meritos
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:191816:103"/>milites? Cur denique fortunam periclita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, before the falling upon a battel at any time, theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are conſtantly to be received:</p>
               <p>That a view be taken of the ſtrength of the Army, and impartially compared with that of the Enemie.</p>
               <p>That the place of Battel be near ſome ſafe Retreat, either of a Camp well entrenched, and ſufficiently left with Guards; or ſome Town of defence near, to friend.</p>
               <p>That all courſes be taken to give cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and confidence to the Souldiers; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome fit applied words of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by ſome incouraging ſtratagems, or by ſhews of contempt of the Enemies ſtrength, or augmentation of his own, or by making ſhew of ſome ſecret intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from the Enemies Camp, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting ſome rumours of their fears and diffidence.</p>
               <p>That in the ordering of the Army to the Battel, the Enemies order be heedfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; as alſo the ſite and form of the place and ground where the Battel is to be fought: to which an anſwerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:191816:103"/>is in every reſpect to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as well in relation to the form as number of Diviſions: as alſo for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Artillery to the beſt uſe, and moſt annoyance of the Enemie.</p>
               <p>And if there be any new Troops that may be ſuſpected in their worth, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially loyalty; That they be placed rather in the Battel, or Middle-Guard it ſelf, then any of the Wings: for being thus order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſhall neither be ſo put to it in point of courage, if they be wanting that way; nor can they find means or ſcope to fling out, or to take advantage to a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as if they were ordered in the Wings: for the Wings in a ſet Battel, are the ſtrength of it, and the principal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it hath ever been found, that as long as they ſtand firm, the day ſtands fair: for by them the Enemy is kept from ſurrounding the main body of the Army. And the ſame Army in the mean time hath the advantage of charging the Enemie in the Flank upon all occaſions and opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.</p>
               <p>Conſideration is alſo to be had, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for the advantage to charge, or to attend the charge. If to charge (which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:191816:104"/>is moſt approvable in an open Country) that then it be performed with the whole Front at once, rather then by light skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes in the Wings and Corners; leſt ſuch of theſe as may chance to be rebutted upon the Main-Vant-guard, ſtrike a terrour, and perhaps diſorder through the whole body of the Army: of which there have been infinite examples.</p>
               <p>An eſpecial obſervation is likewiſe to be made touching the part of the Enemies Army which is firſt to be charged. With the Ancients and many of the Moderns it was a Maxime, that it was to be the weakeſt part. And this was practiſed by <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his firſt Battel with <hi>Arionistus,</hi> and by <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> And the motives hereunto ſeem to be, in regard that mens judgments are favourable to that which happens well at the firſt; the ſequel of every action depending for the moſt part upon the beginning; neither can there be a good end without a good beginning: for though a beginning be often diſaſtrous and unlucky, and the end fortunate and happy, yet before it came to that end, there was a fortunate beginning. And therefore that an Army might foreſee a happy end in a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:191816:104"/>good beginning, it was the ground of this Maxime, that the beginning of the aſſault ſhould be with the beſt of the Army upon the weakeſt part of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>And yet contrary to this Axiome, that abſolute and glorious Souldier, the brave King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in the battel of <hi>Lutzen,</hi> gave order to have the ſtrongeſt part of the Enemies Battel to be firſt charged. For ſeeing the Cuiraſſiers of the Enemies Horſe in one Diviſion by themſelves in the Front, and the Crabrats the light-armed in another; <hi>Charge home</hi> (ſaith he to one of his prime Commanders) <hi>theſe black com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in their compleat Arms, for theſe are they will put us to it; as for the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brats, I care not for them.</hi> By which it is manifeſt, that the ground of this his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was, that the flower of the Enemies Army being well put to it at the firſt (and this was likelieſt to be done beſt, when his men were at the freſheſt) if they ſhould once be routed, it would not onely occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a diſmay to the part where they were, but leave an eaſier task for the routing of all the reſt behind. Neither for my part do I find leſs reaſon for this, then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients and the others did for their practice.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:191816:105"/>
               <p>Laſtly, Care is to be taken before the charge be given, that a Watch-word, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome particular ſigne and viſible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or both the one and other, be impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the whole Army, that in all medlies they may be known one to another, and diſtinguiſhed from the Enemy: and then to give the ſignal of Battel. And the rather, if either any fear or diſorder be perceived amongſt the Enemy, or a forward deſire and heat to the fight with his own men. And theſe are the obſervations and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions requirable before a battel be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and joined.</p>
               <p>The requirables in, and after it, are theſe following: That during the heat of the fight a vigilant eye be carried upon all mutations, that ſo all diſorders may in due time be either prevented or repaired: That if the General (after the fight) finde his ſide to have the worſt of it, he act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which ſhall be obſerved in the Enemies order, and the courage of his own men; and ſo apply himſelf either to rejoin or retire, executing accordingly with vertue, induſtry, and providence: That if after the fight he find himſelf to have the beſt of it, he thorowly to his utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:191816:105"/>proſecute his Victory; and take from the Enemy all means of reuniting his Forces: That he equally diſtribute the ſpoil, with a due reſpect to the quality of the perſons, and vertue of the deſervers; leſt (as now adays in the diſordered diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the age) thoſe come to moſt get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which come to leaſt blows: That (over and above the common diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) all eminencie of worth, whereſoever it be found, be rewarded. And herein were to be wiſhed a renovation of that Roman way, to give ſome portable marks of honour, together with a ſufficiencie of competent ſubſiſtence: That (on the other ſide) all Cowardice be puniſhed, even to the leaſt touch of it, whereſoever it ſhall be found: That mercy be uſed to Captives, and good Quarter given them: That the dead on both ſides be buried: That the acceptable ſacrifice of thankſgiving be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the great giver of Victories, as the gift earneſtly and humbly craved of him, before, at, and after the attempt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the purſuit of a Victory. Reaſons for purſuing a beaten Army, rather then taking in Towns. Of mercy to Captives, termed, Giving of Quarter. Of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be given to Neuters. Orders to be obſerved in the taking of Priſoners.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving in the laſt foregoing Chapter made onely a mention of the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Victories, and the ſhewing of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Captives (in the very latter end of the Chapter) we ſhall in this enlarge our ſelves touching both theſe particulars, as being points of main conſequence and concernment.</p>
               <p>Touching the purſuing of a Victory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the gaining of a Battel, it hath been much controverted amongſt the greateſt Commanders, whether after the routing of an Enemies Army, the broken Army ſhould be thoroughly purſued; or the Conquerours ſhould apply themſelves to the taking in of ſome Frontier Towns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the beaten ſide.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that hold for the taking in of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:191816:106"/>Towns, have delivered theſe reaſons: That the great aſtoniſhment that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly befalleth to ſuch as are beaten out of the Field, doth commonly ſo extend it ſelf to all the Members of that party, that meer fear may procure a rendry of a ſtrong place at the very firſt ſummons, or within two or three days; which at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time would not be carried in twelve moneths, or perhaps not at all. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the taking in of one ſtrong Town is many times of as much importance as the routing of a freſh Army of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and eſpecially when hereby the Enemy ſhall be deprived of all Retreats in thoſe parts. Thirdly, That a routed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thinks of nothing but flight; and therefore is not to be overtaken and ſtaid without great difficulties, and much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſing and toyl of the purſuers. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That a beaten Army thus flying, falls to pieces of it ſelf, and deſerves not any great regard; much leſs are any important opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to be neglected upon this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. On the other ſide, ſuch as argue for the thorow purſuit of a beaten and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army, alledge that hereupon the one of theſe two effects muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:191816:107"/>either that the Enemies Army ſhall hereby be abſolutely defeated, or that they ſhall be conſtrained to capitulate for their Retreat: whereas if they ſhall be quietly ſuffered to paſs without a perfect Rout, their able Commanders may find means in a ſhort time to become once more able to march.</p>
               <p>For mine own part, when I conſider of the reaſons on each ſide, I am made the moſt inclinable to thoſe that hold for the thorow purſuit of the beaten Army. For though a Victory by the gaining of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, may perhaps ſtrike ſome terrour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Beſognes and freſh-water Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and with ſuch procure an eaſie ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of ſuch Towns as are manned with ſuch men; yet with old Souldiers (though beaten) having true Commanders, who always ſell themſelves dear, it procureth a quite contrary effect, and obſtinateth them to all kinds of poſſible defence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, though the taking of ſome one ſtrong Town may (as it may be ſited) prove as gainful as the routing of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Enemies, yet whenſoever the taking of any ſuch place ſhall coſt much time, it ſhall not onely weaken the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:191816:107"/>Army that beſiegeth it, and retard it from making uſe of the Victory lately got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but give the beaten Enemy liberty and opportunity to reinforce their Troops, ſafe-guard their Ordnance, and either by way of diverſion, as falling upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, or by making head againſt the beſieging Enemy himſelf, and cutting him ſhort from Victual, quite alter the Face and fortune of the War. Again, though a routed Army may perhaps for the time think of nothing but a flight, and this may haſten it ſo, as may coſt ſome time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the purſuit; yet being hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the Horſe onely of the Victorious ſide, it muſt needs ſuffer extreamly, and eſpecially the Infantry part, and ten to one in the loſs of their Artillery and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. And all this done without any great or remarkable diſturbance, or haraſſing to the purſuing Army, whoſe very Horſe alone is to put hard to it upon the chaſe; the foot having liberty to march fair and eaſily after, and may come time enough nevertheleſs to fall up with the flying E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, being thus retarded by the Horſe.</p>
               <p>And I am confirmed in this opinion by ſundry preſidents, (amongſt which, two
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:191816:108"/>are very punctual) ſet down by that able French Commander <hi>La Noue</hi> in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Wars of <hi>France</hi> during his time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one of them, that Siege of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> which became the ruine of the Army of thoſe of the Religion, after their Victory at <hi>Rochebelle:</hi> the other, that of St. <hi>Jean d'Angelie,</hi> which proved the like to the French Papiſtical Army, after their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the battel of <hi>Moncontour.</hi> Whereas on the contrary, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> after all his gained battels, did hotly and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly purſue the utter overthrow of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſcattered Troops; and in regard of that, neglected, or at the leaſt ſuſpended the taking in of any of the neighbor Towns, whereabout the battels were fought. And by this courſe prevailed, to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted point, Whether after a Victory in the field the routed Army be to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued to an utter ruine, or the Victory to be made uſe of by the beſieging of ſome Towns belonging to that beaten ſide.</p>
               <p>As for the mercy that upon the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Victory is to be ſhewed to the Captives, generally received under the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:191816:108"/>name of giving good Quarter, and by the French called <hi>Bonne Guerre;</hi> it prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits not onely the killing and murthering of any, much leſs of women and children, or the ſlaying of any in cold bloud, or the not receiving ſuch to mercie (that is, the not giving of them their lives) who ſhall give up themſelves and their Arms priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners after the fight is over; but alſo all baſe and bar barous raviſhments of women, and the like cruelties. And withal (as it is now in practice in our neighbour-wars) all priſoners, being enrolled Souldiers, are to be freed at the ranſome of a moneths pay, according to their ſeveral condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But this general rule is not without ſome exceptions: for if the Governour of a beſieged Town or Fort ſhall defend the place he commands ſo obſtinately, that it be ſtormed and entered by force, and ſo by an aſſault taken, and hereupon he yields himſelf after the heat and violence of the fight be over, to a private Souldier; it ſhall nevertheleſs be lawful (without any breach of Quarter) for the General of the aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Armie to make him die; becauſe this his obſtinate and wilful defence was a treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:191816:109"/>againſt the perſon of the General and the whole Armie, and cannot be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by any condition with a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Alſo if a private Souldier ſhall give Quarter to any Fugitive or Spie, or any one that hath at any time practiſed foul War, or broken Quarter; or to any other which hath formerly deſerved death for ſome capital offence; it is at the Generals pleaſure whether this ſhall be made good unto him or not. Likewiſe, if during the fight of a Battel, many priſoners have Quarter given them upon the routing of ſome parts of that Army, and afterwards ſome parts and diviſions of it, as the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel or the Rear, holding firm, give on ſo ſtoutly, as that the fortune of the day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to a change; and thoſe that had the beſt of it at the firſt, begin to be ſhaken and in danger: it ſhall in this caſe be held no crueltie nor breach of Quarter, though thoſe priſoners that were taken at the firſt, and had Quarter promiſed, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſlain in the field by ſuch as took them; becauſe otherwiſe they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger thoſe that took them, or at the leaſt ask more hands for their ſafe keeping then the exigent will allow to be idle.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:191816:109"/>And thus befel it in one of our braveſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels with the French in <hi>France;</hi> where the French priſoners which were taken at the beginning of the battel upon Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which were very many, and many of note, upon a ſecond charge given by the Duke <hi>d'Alenzon,</hi> were all commanded to be ſlain; which coſt the French doubly dear, the loſs of all their priſoners, and the utter routing of their puiſſant Army.</p>
               <p>It is thought alſo by ſome, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a State Neutral that ſhall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Traffique with an Enemy to another State, may by that State be made prize, and no Quarter to be given them, at leaſt leaſt in point of goods. For (ſay they) though they do not this out of any affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of either love or hatred, but only to make their benefit, and not to any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed relief; yet doth this tranſport of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe prove a plain and direct aid: And in that regard, howſoever brought to the Enemie, deſerveth to be puniſhed with confiſcation at the leaſt; becauſe that out of them Cuſtoms and Impoſts are raiſed, whereby their War is maintained. But of the right of this I make a Querie; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it rather to be underſtood onely of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:191816:110"/>Munition, and Materials of that nature; for otherwiſe it muſt neceſſarily overthrow all manner of Trade, and ſet the whole World together by the ears.</p>
               <p>Touching ſuch orders as are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the taking of Priſoners by thoſe taht take them, I finde them to have been theſe, by thoſe of our own Nation. That if any Common Souldier did take a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and another coming up at the ſame time ſhould challenge the half of his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or elſe threaten to kill the Priſoner, the menacer was to have no part at all of it; no, though the taker of him had made him any ſuch promiſe. And if the Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer did kill the Priſoner, he ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Arreſt with the Marſhal untill he compound with the partie for the loſs of his Priſoner: and beſides, he was to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his Horſe and Arms to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.</p>
               <p>That if any Souldier in any fight did beat down any one of the Enemie, and ſo leaving him, purſue on in the chaſe or fight, and another come up after him and take the ſame man priſoner; this Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thus beaten down, and thus taken, when he was to be ranſomed, was to pay
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:191816:110"/>the one half of his ranſome to him that firſt ſtruck him down, and the other half to him that took him priſoner.</p>
               <p>That whoſoever he were that took any Priſoner, he was, as ſoon as poſſibly he could, to preſent him to his Captain or Commander, upon the penalty of loſing his part of the Priſoners ranſom to the ſaid Captain or Commander; and the Captain or Commander to preſent this Priſoner to the General, Conſtable, or Marſhal of the Army, before any other ſpeak with him, that ſo his examination might be duly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And this to be done under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie of loſing his Thirds of the Priſoners ranſome (which otherwiſe was due unto him by his place) unto him that did firſt diſcover the default unto the Conſtable or Marſhal. And that every one in whoſe cuſtodie this Priſoner ſhould chance to be, was to be careful to conceal from him all the ſecrets and Avenues upon the Camp. To which end, he was not to be ſuffered to walk at large, nor to range a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout without a good Guard upon him; and this upon pain of loſing his Priſoners ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; whereof the one third part was to be allowed to his Captain, the other third
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:191816:111"/>to the Conſtable, and the laſt to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: And the perſon alſo of the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to be under arreſt at the Generals pleaſure. Neither was any man to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom his Priſoner without Licence of the General, or the Conſtable, or Marſhal; nor any private perſon to give any ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct to any Priſoner, upon pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of all his Goods, and his body to be under arreſt during the Kings pleaſure. And whoſoever violated the Kings or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals ſafe-conduct, was to be hanged, drawn, and quartered.</p>
               <p>And being thus fallen upon the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Delinquents in a Martial way, we ſhall in the next Chapter ſay ſomewhat of Martial Courts.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Martial Courts in an Army Royal: the manner of Trials in them. Of the puniſhments inflicted upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents in theſe Courts. Of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in crimes not capital.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN a well diſciplined Army three ſeveral kindes of Martial Courts are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted: for it is a noveltie to have Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Law denied in the Government of an Army in the Field, and an abſurd one.</p>
               <p>The firſt Martial Court conſiſteth of all the Commanders in chief, with the Colonels, and Judge-Marſhal General. And this Court, after due notice taken of the offence, pronounceth ſentence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. And from this Court lieth no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal; but to it may Appeals be made from any of the other two.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond rank are thoſe Courts which are Weekly held in every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and oftner if cauſe require. And the Colonels of the Regiments, with the Judge-Marſhals, here ſit in their ſeveral
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:191816:112"/>Courts, and pronounce ſentence upon the Delinquents of their ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments.</p>
               <p>Of the third rank is that Court where the Judge-Marſhal of the Army, and the Judge-Marſhals of the Regiments ſit, and onely they. And this Court takes notice of all Cauſes both criminal and civil; and is inſtituted for the eaſe of the Commanders. And into this Court the offenders and their offences are preſented by the Provoſt-Marſhals of the Regiments: whoſe office alſo it is to produce the accuſers, and to attend the trials and cenſures; the which they are alſo to ſee executed.</p>
               <p>Touching the manner and form of the Trials in all theſe Courts, they are not much diſſonant from thoſe in Courts Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ordinarily practiſed: for the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers are heard upon their oaths, as alſo the witneſſes. And the accuſed have full libertie to ſpeak for themſelves, and are to be heard with patience and equanimitie. Onely the Deciſions, in ſtead of common Jurors, are paſſed by moſt voices, being the Votes of ſuch Commanders as ſit Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the ſeveral Courts; and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

And theſe Forms and courſes of Trials ſeem to me without exception; and are ſo proper and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the well regulating and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Army, in regard that delays of execution upon Delinquents in many caſes cannot be endured without thouſands of varieties of danger; that for my part I cannot underſtand how an Army can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without them</p>
               <p>As for the puniſhments inflicted upon Delinquents by theſe Courts; in capital cauſes, they are, Shooting to death, which is held the faireſt; Hanging, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Empaling. That Delinquent is to be ſhot to death, who killeth any man in Duel within Cannon-ſhot of the Camp; or that maketh any attempt upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my without direction or leave from his ſuperiour Commander.</p>
               <p>He is to be hanged that Robbeth, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, deſperately and obſtinately Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemes; that is a Mutineer or an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Mutinies; that reſcueth offenders
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:191816:113"/>from the execution of a Cenſure: That ſtriketh his Commander: That wilfully diſchargeth his Piece to give a falſe alarm in the night, or in any ambuſh by day: That licenſeth Souldiers for money to leave the Army, without leave of the General: That takes pay of two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains: That fights or quarrels in the inſtant of ſervice, or upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; in which caſe alſo it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for any Souldier to kill ſuch a Souldier: That abſents himſelf from his Duties: That abandons his Colours in danger to be loſt: That diſperſeth falſe News or Reports, of purpoſe to diſcourage his Companions: That ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth from his Colours in a march, or keeps not his appointed place: That gives not the Alarm to the Camp upon juſt cauſe when he ſtands Centinel: That anſwers not all Alarms: That goes out of the Camp or Trenches by any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way ſave the common ones: That ſells his Horſe or Arms when Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is expected: That ſuccours not his General or Captain being in danger: That quits a place committed to his charge being not enforced by the Enemy.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:191816:113"/>
               <p>That offender is to be Empaled, that willingly and of purpoſe changeth the Watch-word, or makes it known to the Enemy: That committeth treaſon againſt the perſon of the General, or Army in general: That poiſons the Artillery, or by any ways maliciouſly makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable, or endeavours to make it ſo: And laſtly, That entertains any ſecret intelligence with the Enemy. And theſe are the capital puniſhments for capital offences.</p>
               <p>As for the inferiour and leſs capital: He is to be impriſoned that fights, ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſwears, couzens, drinks drunk: That is a common Gameſter, abſents himſelf from his Quarter by night: That pays not the Merchants, Artificers, or Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers their dues: That either by negligence or folly diſcovers any purpoſe or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Army: That ſtrikes or beats any Souldier without cauſe: That neglects Divine Service.</p>
               <p>He is to undergo the Cudgel, that is contumax or inſolent towards his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders: That keeps not his Arms clean and in point: That either ſells or pawns his Arms; or buys or takes any Arms to pawn.</p>

Of the fitteſt places for Ambuſhments. Of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Horſe-men and Foot-men, which to be preferred.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE ſhall in this Chapter give ſome advertiſements (and that very brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) about two particulars not yet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; Touching the laying out of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhments, with the prevention of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into them; and the comparing of Horſe and Foot in the advantages and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:191816:114"/>diſadvantages they have one of another; that ſo the diſcreet Commander may make uſe of them accordingly.</p>
               <p>As touching the laying out of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhments, the eſpecial point to be aimed at and heeded, is, That it be done in ſuch a part as may leaſt be ſuſpected; and in ſuch a manner, that the Enemie may fall within the danger of them. To give co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour whereunto, one common trick hath been, to pretend aforehand (in ſuch a kinde, that the Enemy may ſo conceive it) ſome fear, and ſo a flight; or ſome want of neceſſaries, and the like; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Enemy may be drawn to a more eager and bold purſuit, and ſo the more heedleſly and unrecoveredly fall within the danger of the Ambuſh. And many other the like practices of this nature may be thought upon to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As for the courſes of prevention from falling into theſe Ambuſhes, it is a good general rule to ſuſpect all ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves and fallings off of an Enemie. In which caſe an exact and cautious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is to be made, even to the very place where there is any intention to lodge. And the manner obſerved in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:191816:115"/>theſe diſcoveries have uſually been, to ſend out Parties in three Companies or Diviſions: the firſt to conſiſt of a ſmall number, to beat the way at eaſe, and to range about from place to place, where any danger may be expected. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Partie to be ſomewhat ſtronger, the better to ſecond and bring off the firſt upon all occaſions. And the third to be ſo ſtrong as to make head againſt, and to engage a ſtrong Partie of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, if he ſhall preſent it. And thus did <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his ſo famous deſcent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his fore-runners and diſcoverers in the like caſe, (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> lays it down) and that with very good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted, that theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries are ever to be made with the light-armed Troops. For it being a point of no ſmall concernment, to be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly informed of the true diſtances of the places, the condition of the ways, the nature of the hills, and the courſe and paſſages of the Rivers where the Army is to paſs; this cannot better be performed (nor ſo well) as by the light-armed. And being by them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:191816:115"/>done, afforded incomparable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; good diſcoveries being the very eyes of an Army, whereby the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of providence are guided, and the path of ſafety delineated, that ſo there may be no ſtumbling upon caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And all this is attained by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect intelligence of the true face of the Country, and in knowing the motions of the Enemy. And the face of the Country is beſt known by the uſe and employment of the native Guides of the Countrie; provided that they be always aſſociated with ſome faithful Scouts of ones own, that ſo there need not be an abſolute reliance upon a ſtrangers infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And as for the motions of the Enemie, they may be ſureſt had by the light armed Horſe; who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs are not to be over-forward in inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon every new trifling motion, but to have their intelligence confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them by divers and various ways and means; leſt ſome errour and miſtake befal them thorough paſſion or affection: as to thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> who thorough the paſſion of fear took a field of great Thiſtles, for a mightie Body of Pikes.</p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:191816:116"/>
               <p>As touching the fitteſt perſons to be laid out in Ambuſhes: It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that all Ambuſhments are made uſe of either to endanger and enſnare the Enemy in a fight in the Field, or to entrap and hinder him in his march. And examples of each ſort are found frequently practiſed by that ſubtle <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> in his Italian Wars: In the firſt whereof, he conſtantly employed as well the heavy armed Souldiers as the light. In the ſecond, the light-armed alone; whoſe agilitie and expedition gave them oportunity and advantage with their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive weapons to aſſault and annoy the Enemie, though the ground were never ſo ſtrait or uneven. And theſe alſo might be more eaſily lodged without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie.</p>
               <p>As for the parts and places moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and fit for the receipt and lodging of theſe Ambuſhes; they are ſuch as are moſt removed from the view, as Woods, Mountains, Foreſts, Rocks, Banks of Rivers, Hollow and deep ways: In ſhort, any place or piece of Ground, wherein ſome numbers and Troops of Souldiers may beſt lie obſcured and hid. And
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:191816:116"/>thus much touching the ordering and diſpoſal of Ambuſhes, with the uſe of them.</p>
               <p>We are now to fall upon a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between the Cavalrie and Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie in point of War; with reſpect to the advantages or diſadvantages they have one above another, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſervices and occaſions they may be employed in. Touching which, ſuch as prefer the Foot-men or Infantrie before the Cavalrie or Horſe, give theſe Reaſons: That the Foot may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in all places, and upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; whereas the Horſe in craggie and rough ways are of little or no uſe at all: That the Foot are more ready and leſs chargeable; and being well led and armed, indure the ſhock better then the Horſe can: That in the guarding of Towns, and all places of ſtrength, Foot-men have the prioritie of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in reſpect of the point of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; it being more difficult and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome for a Commander to feed his Horſes, then to feed and diſcipline his men: That at aſſaults of Towns, Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are of ſmall uſe, if they leave not
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:191816:117"/>their Horſes; and then they are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Horſe-men: That at ſet Fields and Battels, Foot-men having means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench themſelves, and having good Pikes and ſtore, have always been found more then equal to Horſe-men. In Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, Foot-men are more ſpeedily raiſed, and led and lodged with more facilitie: They are paid with leſs charge then the Horſe: They fight more ſafely, rally themſelves more certainly, and eaſily: And laſtly, Horſe are hard to be found in any great numbers; for it may be believed that there are twentie men to one Horſe in the World. And theſe are the proper priorities of Foot-men over Horſe-men, which have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as well by the Antients as the Moderns. To which alſo (in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) may be added, That the Foot are by far more fit for all ſorts of Ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then the Horſe can be, in regard they may be lodged more ſecretly; and eſpecially in reſpect that Horſe are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject to diſcover themſelves by their noiſe and neighing. And beſides, the beſt man of courage that breathes, is in a fight ſubjected to the diſorder and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:191816:117"/>unmanageableneſs of his Horſe that he rides upon.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, thoſe that prefer Horſe-men before Foot-men, give theſe inſtances: That a Horſe-man hath ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better legs then his own: That he chargeth more furiouſly: That he hath more force and breath then a Foot-man: That Horſe have the advantage in long marches and haſty purſuits: That they have more means to ſurprize an Enemie: That they have more oportunities to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, to ſeize upon, to cut off, and to hold all paſſages; to inveſt Towns on a fuddain, to anſwer Alarms and to give them; to command the Field, to make a ſpoil, to cut off all ſupplies, either of Victuals or Munition, then any Foot can poſſibly have.</p>
               <p>And thus we have done with theſe two particulars, and finiſh the Chapter.</p>

               <p>IN the laſt Chapter having laid down ſome rules for the ordering and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Ambuſhments, we ſhall in this take occaſion from them to intimate ſomewhat concerning Stratagems of War. And becauſe theſe are ſo diverſified and varied upon ſeveral occaſions, that for the moſt part they are in that reſpect
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:191816:118"/>beyond any ſet rules; we ſhall onely particularize in ſuch as being of the moſt general extention, may happily be made uſe of by way of Renovation and Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>And we will begin with a ſtratagem, whereby a beſieged Enemie may be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened and terrified by a ſuppoſed Mine when there is none. And this was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> (not the father of the great <hi>Alexander,</hi> but he who was afterwards vanquiſhed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by the Romanes) who beſieging the Town of <hi>Prinaſſus,</hi> attempted it by a Mine; but finding the earth and part ſo ſtonie, that it deſpaired him of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that way, he cauſed his Pioneers to continue the ſemblance of working, and to make an extraordinary noiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground: and the more to add a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their working, he cauſed a great quantitie of earth to be brought ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the nights from elſewhere, and ſo laid in heaps at the entrance and mouth of the ſuppoſed Mine, that the Enemie might well diſcern it, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it was taken and digged out
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:191816:119"/>of the Mine. And after ſome time ſpent in this manner, he ſummoned thoſe of the Town to a rendition; ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them word that by his underminings, their Towns Wall, to the quantity of two acres of ground, ſtood onely upon wooden props; to which whenſoever he did give fire, that part of their Wall would lie flat on the ground: the which if they did attend, and cauſe him to enter by a breach, they were not to expect any Quarter or Mercie; and therefore wiſhed them to conſider of their condition, and to do as they found cauſe. Now the <hi>Prineſſians</hi> little think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe heaps of earth which they ſaw, had been brought from other places, but that it had been taken out of the Mine; ſo loſt their courages, as that they ſuffered themſelves to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braved, and thereupon gave up their Town upon a meer panick fear.</p>
               <p>And as this was a Stratagem to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and work upon a falſe fear; ſo theſe three following were to recover from the like.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Army
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:191816:119"/>being on the ſudden in a great fear, of they knew not what, <hi>Alexander</hi> at that very inſtant cauſed them all to be diſarmed; whereby they became aſſured that this would not have been commanded, if there had been any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clearchus</hi> to pacifie a fooliſh conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and uproar of this nature amongſt his men, proclaimed a reward to him that could tell who had ſent the Aſs into the Camp. And thus by doing ſomewhat quite contrary to that which the peril would have required had it been true, he gave a full aſſurance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which was falſe, and which his men had onely faſhioned in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed imaginations and conceits.</p>
               <p>The third example to this purpoſe (which withal alſo expreſſed a magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie, which both ſuſtained Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and augmented it) was that act of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> which was done when <hi>Hannibal</hi> made his bold approach upon the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> whileſt the main of the <hi>Romane</hi> forces were at the Siege of <hi>Capua.</hi> For the Commanders at <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:191816:120"/>finding that the City by reaſon hereof was ſubject to Fears and Tumults, at the very ſame inſtant cauſed a ſupply that had formerly been appointed for <hi>Spain,</hi> to march out of the City at one Gate in purſuit of their firſt Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whileſt the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Armie lay before the other; whereby they not onely checked the bold confidence of the Enemie, but took off that fear which clouded their own Valour.</p>
               <p>To which purpoſe alſo that very piece of ground on which the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Armie lay encamped, was at the ſame time ſold in <hi>Rome;</hi> and bought (ſaith the Story) nothing at all under the Value, but at the ſame rate as if it had been in the former times of peace. The which act and ſale, ſo madded even <hi>Hannibal</hi> himſelf, that to make a ſhew of being even with them, he made a Port-ſale of all the Silver-Smiths Shops which were near about the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket or Common place in <hi>Rome:</hi> As if he would ſeem to think that his own Title and Intereſt to thoſe Shops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town, was no jot worſe then
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:191816:120"/>any <hi>Romane</hi> Citizens to that piece of ground where his Tent ſtood.</p>
               <p>But this Counter-piece of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> was not of ſo good ſtuff as that of the <hi>Romanes:</hi> for their act was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a thorough manifeſtation of an aſſurance grounded hopefully, and was onely acted to ſtir up the courages of their men; whereas <hi>Hannibals</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a paſſionate ſhew, and an angry Brave of a continuance in a hope which he well knew was already paſt: His Victuals being at the ſame time ſo near at an end, that of all thoſe Hopes and Ends which he had propounded to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by this his approach ſo near unto <hi>Rome,</hi> the fame onely of his much daring is left to poſterity.</p>
               <p>It is true that <hi>Hannibal</hi> partly was quit with theſe <hi>Romanes</hi> by a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of another nature, that he put in practice at <hi>Tarentum;</hi> when having ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the Town, and entering it at two ſeveral Gates, ſo that the <hi>Romane</hi> Gariſon with the Governour were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire themſelves into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, the which it behooved <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:191816:121"/>ſpeedily to take in, in regard of the Vicinitie of the <hi>Romane</hi> Armie: he addreſſed himſelf againſt it in ſuch a manner of Brave, as was likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Gariſon to a Sallie; hoping hereby to give them ſuch a blow as might diſable them to defend the piece any longer.</p>
               <p>And according to his expectation, the <hi>Romanes</hi> not enduring in ſuch a ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſhion to be approached upon, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out in a heat of furie with moſt of their braveſt men, and charged them home. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> having ordered beforehand that his men ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fall back as if they were terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until he had drawn out as many of the beſieged <hi>Romanes</hi> as he could, and as far from their ſtrength as he could; he then gave the ſignal to his <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who lay prepared and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhed for the purpoſe, and ſuddenly and fiercely ſetting upon the ſallied <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> not onely forced ſuch as were neareſt home to retire themſelves into their Hold, but laid on the ground all the forwardeſt and beſt of their men;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:191816:121"/>ſo that they durſt not iſſue out a ſecond time, but were conſtrained to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Hannibal</hi> to make his approaches at pleaſure, whereby he forced the place.</p>
               <p>And as this was a Stratagem to draw Souldiers into an over-daring, ſo that which followeth is to win them into an over-ſecuritie; and was acted in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great, in his Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was wholly governed by one <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias,</hi> an ambitious man, and a maligner of Vertue. At the ſame time one <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> the Kings Lieutenant in <hi>Media</hi> was broken out into a Rebellion, and ſought to make himſelf Lord of that Province. <hi>Antiochus</hi> being entered at the ſame time into a War with <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie Philopater</hi> the Egyptian King, was counſelled by his Minion <hi>Hermias</hi> (who had put him upon the Egyptian War) to ſend againſt this Rebel, who was but a Captain, a Captain that was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but himſelf to go in perſon againſt the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who was a King like himſelf. Hereupon one <hi>Xenetas</hi> an
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:191816:122"/>
                  <hi>Achaean</hi> (by <hi>Hermias</hi> his choice and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment) was ſent with an Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rebel <hi>Molo,</hi> whileſt the King <hi>Antiochus</hi> himſelf marched againſt the Egyptian.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Xenetas</hi> drawing near unto the River <hi>Tigris</hi> with his Armie, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide whereof the Rebel lay to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his paſſage, made a ſhew as if he would paſs the River by Boats in the very face of the Enemie; but leaving ſo many onely as he thought ſufficient to defend his Camp, he himſelf, with the flower and ſtrength of his Armie paſſed over <hi>Tigris</hi> in a place ten miles lower then where <hi>Molo</hi> lay entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; who hearing of it, ſent out his Horſe to give impediment: But finding that <hi>Xenetas</hi> could not be ſtopped, he practiſed this enſuing Stratagem to draw his Enemie into a ſnare of ſecuritie. He no ſooner found that <hi>Xenetas</hi> with his whole Armie marched towards him, but preſently he diſlodged, making a ſhew of taking a haſtie journey home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: and to poſſeſs the Enemie that it was done in a fear, he withal left
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:191816:122"/>all his Baggage and Victual behinde in his Camp. <hi>Xenetas</hi> hearing of this his Retreat, eaſily ſuffered himſelf (more like a Courtier then a Souldier) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Enemie durſt not ſo much as look him in the face; and the rather, in that he was informed that he had left his forſaken Camp well ſtored with Victuals and Bootie: whereupon haſtily marching thitherward, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to his expectation, he not only ſuffered his men to feaſt and drink to their full; but invited and commanded them to do ſo, making proclamation that they ſhould cheriſh up themſelves againſt the march that he intended to begin the next day, in purſuit of the flying Rebel. But <hi>Molo,</hi> who remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no farther the firſt day then he could eaſily make back again the ſame night, underſtanding what good rule the Kings men kept with his Victuals, made ſuch a ſpeedy and oportune re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that he came upon them early in the morning whileſt they were yet in their Wine and Chear, with his full force; and giving them a luſty Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſado,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:191816:123"/>ſo confounded them amidſt their pots, that their General <hi>Xenetas,</hi> with a very few beſides, dying fighting, the reſt were ſlaughtered ere they could finde their Arms, and the moſt of them before they were perfectly awake and recovered of their Wine; leaving by their over-ſecuritie an abſolute Victory to their ſubtle Enemie.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it is a requirable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, after a General hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Victory, and received his Enemie upon Quarter, be it either in a Town newly taken in, or in the Field, to be wary of an over-confidence in their Faith and Loyaltie (eſpecially when the Enemie is near) but rather by all ſearching ways to diſcover, if it were poſſible, their very hearts: That Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem which to this purpoſe was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Spaniards at their taking of the City <hi>Verona</hi> from the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, may ſerve for a preſident for the future in the like caſe; which was this:</p>
               <p>The Venetian Armie lying near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, which was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:191816:123"/>taken in by the Spaniard upon Compoſition; the Spaniſh Governour aiming to underſtand how the Burgers and Citizens in general ſtood affected to their old Patrons the Venetians, gave ſecret order to the Spaniſh Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon that was in Guard of the Town, that in the dead of the night when the Towns-men were aſleep, they ſhould run to and fro about the Citie, and crie out, St. <hi>Mark,</hi> St. <hi>Mark,</hi> as if the Town had been ſurprized by the Venetians. The which crie being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily anſwered by as many of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens as ſecretly favoured the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and were ready to receive them; the Spaniards obſerving their Houſes, marked their dores with ſome Chalk, or the like: And being thus diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Governour the very next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning impriſoned the chiefeſt of them, and confiſcated all their Goods; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he not onely ſecured the Town, but contented the Gariſon with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations; the Souldiers being at the ſame time inclinable to a mutiny for want of pay.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:191816:124"/>
               <p>Nor is there any thing of a more dangerous conſequence, then for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (eſpecially upon the point of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) to be found in this condition of a Mutinie for pay. And the ill effects thereof have many times ſorted to an abſolute ruine; and above all other parts, in the Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> and chiefly of late years; where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon crie, even at the exigent of a Fight, hath been, <hi>Ghelt, Ghelt,</hi> Money, Money: And ſometimes occaſion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereupon by the Souldier to ſeize upon the perſons of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to deliver both them and themſelves to the Enemies mercie. For the cure, or at the leaſt Palliation of which deſperate diſeaſe, ſome brave Commanders have been forced (with good ſucceſs) to practice this Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemical courſe: To borrow of their chief Officers, upon fair and promiſing terms, ſuch ſums of money as could be gotten and ſpared on the ſudden: whereby was attained not onely ſome ſatisfaction for the Common Souldiers, by letting them feel ſome piece of a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:191816:124"/>Pay, and making them to apprehend that their General had a care and love of them, by thus engaging of himſelf to give them content: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Tie upon all the Officers that made this Lone, cauſing them to be true and faithful unto the General who had borrowed theſe moneys of them; that ſo they might be in the better poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie to reimburſe their lent moneys, with the uſury of a thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</p>
               <p>And an example of this we ſhall finde punctually practiſed by <hi>Caeſar</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by himſelf in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Civil Wars between him and <hi>Pompey, cap.</hi> 14.) For being to paſs ſuddenly into <hi>Spain,</hi> and to pay a great Armie, which required much preſent money; he borrowed all the money he could of his Centurions and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, and gave it out preſently and publickly to his Souldiers: whereby (ſaith he of himſelf) <hi>Caeſar</hi> both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his Captains to a dependencie upon him, in reſpect of their Lone; and won the affection of his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:191816:125"/>by his Largeſs, and made them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to fight.</p>
               <p>Now though an Army be never ſo well affected to their General, and as willing thereupon to engage their lives in his Quarrel and under his conducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as can be wiſhed; yet when an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-powerful Enemie is to be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and ready for a battel, it is the wiſdom of an able General by all means to ſeek to avoid it.</p>
               <p>Towards which this Stratagem fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing much conduceth, and may be drawn into Preſident, as it is ſet down in <hi>Polien. (lib.</hi> 4. <hi>in vit. Antig.</hi>) and practiſed by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> when he was encamped in the face of <hi>Enmenes</hi> his Armie, but with an Armie by much inferiour in number. At what time Meſſengers (or rather Spies) being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably ſent from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Antigonus</hi> at the receipt of a Meſſenger from the Enemie, which he expected, had fore-appointed that one of his Souldiers ſhould come running, and as it were breathleſs, and all to be duſted and ſweaty, and tell him that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:191816:125"/>all his Confederates were arrived. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Tale <hi>Antigonus</hi> expreſſing much joy, preſently diſmiſſed the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Meſſenger without more ado. And the very next day he brings his Army out of his Trenches, doubling the length of his Front, to make his Armie carry the greater ſhew. The which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie ſeeing, and having heard the report of their Meſſenger, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the breadth of <hi>Antigonus</hi> his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and imagining that the depth was anſwerable to it; he ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged, and was afraid to joyn battel with him; which was the onely thing that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> deſired.</p>
               <p>And as this is a Stratagem to ſhun and decline a Battel when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is found too ſtrong; ſo this other ſucceeding is very pertinent, on the other ſide, to draw and entice him to a fight when he is known too weak.</p>
               <p>And this Stratagem alſo is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by <hi>Polienus (Lib.</hi> 2. in <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridas, Sect.</hi> 4.) where <hi>Cleandridas</hi> making War upon the Thurians, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:191816:126"/>having double the number of men in his Army to that of his Enemie; and conceiving that if he did but know ſo much, he ſhould never bring him to a battel: To deceive him, and embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him by his ignorance, in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelling of his Armie or Phalanx, he ordered it into an extraordinary depth: whereupon the Enemie apprehending by the narrowneſs of the Front that <hi>Cleandridas</hi> was very weak in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, contemning his ſmall ſtrength, drew out his Forces in breadth, with an intent to environ him. The which <hi>Cleandridas</hi> perceiving, commanded the one half of his Files to march up and rank with their Leaders; and thereby ſo over-fronted the Enemie on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, unexpectedly aſſaulting him withal with miſſive weapons on all ſides, as he utterly routed him.</p>
               <p>As touching the practice of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate attempts in Military Actions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſperate exigents: It may prove ſometimes a profitable Stratagem to attempt and put that in execution, which otherwiſe in it ſelf were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:191816:126"/>to Reaſon it ſelf, and the very Art of War: which may be grounded upon this:</p>
               <p>That in regard a wary and able Commander and Generall not onely paſſeth upon tried and ſure Grounds himſelf, but even from thence and the very ſame Rules expecteth the like from others; upon finding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practiſed by his Enemie beyond his apprehenſion and expectance, he may thereby be happily ſo diſturbed in his ſet Reſolutions and Courſes, and be ſo new to ſeek, as may (before he can recal himſelf out of his amazes) give oportunity to the deſperate attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter to free himſelf out of his deſperate condition.</p>
               <p>And Examples proving thus much are to be found put upon even <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf by the <hi>Nervii,</hi> (regiſtred by himſelf in his Commentaries, <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) as alſo in that battel of his with <hi>Pharnaces.</hi> And in our Modern Wars this practice hath proved ſucceſsful more then once, in thoſe violent Civil Broyls in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:191816:127"/>
               <p>True it is, that theſe ways and ſtratagems are to be charily and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſparingly handled; and onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſt urging, if not deſperate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: For, <hi>Temeritas non ſemper Foelix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since therefore there is ſo much of Advice and Counſel requirable in all Actions of War, we will conclude this Treatiſe with a preventative Policie or Stratagem for the taking away of falſe or flattering reſpects in the point of delivering opinions. For it being over-commonly found, that through the obſequious dependance upon ſome Favourite or great Man, a general conſent and compliance is produced, to ſay as he ſaith, or vote as he votes (a fatal diſeaſe in all great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies) though perhaps it be either the worſt that can be, or at the leaſt, none of the beſt; and by this means the trueſt judgements remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed:</p>
               <p>To remedie this dangerous and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſchief, the wiſe <hi>Coſmo di Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> (and herein alſo imitated by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:191816:127"/>the ſecond of <hi>Spain</hi>) uſed to propound his moſt difficult and important Cauſes and Propoſitions in Writing; and ſo delivered them to every one of his Counſellors apart, commanding them to return their opinions in the ſame manner to him, together with their reaſons; and (upon his higheſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) not to communicate any piece of them with any other, before his firſt view. And after the receipt of them all, he would cauſe them all to appear in Council with him, and in his preſence to defend and maintain their ſeveral Judgements and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with their beſt Arguments. A courſe certainly full of excellent free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and for many reſpects far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that the youngeſt Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſhould ſpeak firſt; who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be ſo skilful in Courtſhip of this nature, as to be led by looks.</p>
               <p>And beſides, it alloweth theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours a fit time of deliberation to think upon what they have to ſay; it being dangerous in theſe Caſes,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:191816:128"/>or any of weight, either Divine or Humane (be the Speakers never ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to be too forward to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon Extempories.</p>
